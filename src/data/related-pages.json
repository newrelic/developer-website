      "body": "The second version of our StatsD integration was released on May 25 2020. It's an improvement on our first StatsD integration. Improvements include: simpler configuration, and a simpler method for adding tags (key-value pairs). Features Our StatsD integration (version 2) lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ _ NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' _ address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: Remember to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

      "body": "Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal. You can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. In short, you can use the CLI to automate common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic user key. An instrumented application in your New Relic account. Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI Download the New Relic CLI for your operating system, as described below. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Using Snapcraft, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Using Homebrew, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Using Scoop, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile. After you install the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. Run the profiles add command: bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Important You must set the region of your New Relic account. Use -r to set either us or eu. Step 3 of 10 Get your application details. Now, add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 Retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application, use the apm application search command: bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Tip If you get an error, check that your account ID and application name are correct. Step 5 of 10 Find the guid value. If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example: [ { \"accountId\": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, \"applicationId\": YOUR_APP_ID, \"domain\": \"APM\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"A_LONG_GUID\", \"name\": \"NAME_OF_YOUR_APP\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" } ] Copy When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application. Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Here, you add an environment tag to your application. Add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 Add tag sets. What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags to your application at once, modify and run this snippet: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 Retrieve your application's tags. You've created and added some tags to your application, but to test that they're working, you need to retrieve them. Run the entity tags get command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array: [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: create a deployment marker. Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same application ID from your earlier search: bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Check the JSON response for the revision and timestamp of the deployment. You can build this workflow into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here's an example: { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands in the New Relic CLI. For example, you can create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "Golden metrics and golden tags are bits of information about an entity that we consider to be the most important for that entity. We use this information to display a brief overview of an entity across all New Relic. You can see and contribute to the standard definitions of the golden metrics and tags in this public repository. This document explains how to query an entity's custom metrics using NerdGraph. Tip For more on how to query entities using the NerdGraph API, see our tutorial. Fetch golden metrics When fetching golden metrics for a specific GUID or list of GUIDS, the provided queries are already filtered for you. You can run the resulting query as is in the query builder. The resulting metric can be either a timeseries or a single value. Here's an example of one golden metric query for an AWS DynamoDB table entity with the GUID ExampleGUID. SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('ExampleGUID') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' TIMESERIES Copy You can use NerdGraph to query for the golden metrics of a specific entity; for example: { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenMetrics {   metrics { query title   } } } } } Copy Fetch golden tags Golden tags are always represented the same way, whether requested by GUID or by entityType. You will always receive the list of tag keys considered the most important about the entity. { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenTags { tags { key } } } } } Copy Customize golden metrics and golden tags If you want to change the golden metrics and golden tags based on the specificities of your environment, you can override them in two different contexts, in your account, or in a workload. Override golden metrics or golden tags for a specific entity type in your whole account In this case, the new golden metrics or the new golden tags will be applied in all New Relic One, converting your new metrics and tags as the default for the specified entity type. To do that, you can use a NerdGraph mutation to override the golden metrics for a specific entity. mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from. In this case, you should set the account that you want to override. metrics: The new NRDB query will be shown as golden metrics. eventId: The field used to filter the entity in the metric. How the entity GUID is defined in your event. select: The SELECT clause of the NRDB query. This field is required. from: The FROM clause of the NRDB query. where: Complementary where clause to identify the entity type field. facet: The field to FACET. title: The title of the golden metric. This field is optional. name: The name of the golden metric. This field is required. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy The metrics input object defines the parts of an NRDB query, split into sections. One of these sections is the eventId, which is used to identify the field that defines the GUID inside the NRDB Event you want to use as a golden metric. For example: SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('EntityGuid') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' FACET entityName TIMESERIES Copy It's defined as follows: { eventId: \"entityGuid\", from: \"DatastoreSample\", where: \"provider='DynamoDbTable'\", facet: \"entityName\", select: \"average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average)\", name: GetItem latency (ms), title: GetItem latency (ms) } Copy As you can see in the resultant object, the where clause only contains the provider field. The system adds the where clause with the eventId field by default. You can do the same for the golden tags using this NerdGraph mutation: mutation { entityGoldenTagsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, tags: [{key: \"applicationName\"} , {key: \"environment\"} ]) { errors { message type } tags { context { account } domainType { domain type } tags { key } } } } Copy Override golden metrics from a particular entity type in a workload New Relic's workloads provide an aggregated view of health and performance data about a group of entities. The time series charts shown for each entity type in a workload are defined by the golden metrics in the workload account. If you want to further customize which time series to show for a specific entity type in a particular workload, override the golden metrics in the account with the following mutation: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy See above for details on each field. In this case, context is the workload's GUID. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Fetch the custom golden metrics and golden tags The queries defined in the previous sections always return the default golden metrics and golden tags. If you want to fetch your custom golden metrics or golden tags, you need to send the context defined in the query, for example: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenMetrics( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { metrics { title query name } } } } } Copy For golden tags: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenTags(context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { tags { key } } } } } Copy You can send both contexts simultaneously for querying, if your metrics or tags have the context inside the workload. The API returns the most specific golden metric or golden tags based on the context that you defined in the requests. The priority is workload and account. Reset custom metrics and golden tags If your custom golden metrics are not relevant to you any more, you can restore the defaults defined by New Relic. In the context parameter, set the desired account or workload guid (in the guid parameter). To restore your golden metrics in an account, run this query: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsReset( context: {guid: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN_METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from. In this case, you should set the account you want to reset. To restore your golden metrics in a workload, run this query: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsReset( context: {guid: GUID_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN_METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy You can do the same for your custom golden tags: mutation { entityGoldenTagsReset( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}) { errors { message type } tags { key context { account guid } domainType { domain type } tags { key } } } } Copy Expected errors All these mutations can answer with the result of the operation or a list of errors. These are all the expected errors that you can receive: INVALID_CONTEXT: The context is not valid. There can only be one context, an account or a workload's GUID. If you use both, or use any other concept, or a GUID that doesn't belong to a workload, you will get this error. INVALID_DOMAIN_TYPE: The domain type is not valid. LIMIT_EXCEEDED: The maximum amount of metrics is 9. If you exceed this limit you will get this error. NOT_AUTHORIZED: The user doesn't have the permissions to carry out this action.",

      "body": "New Relic mobile monitoring includes a number of ways to customize and extend the data your mobile app reports. We refer to this type of implementation as \"custom instrumentation.\" This document explains how to get additional data into New Relic, and how to view that new data in the UI. Choose a custom data type You can use these options to create your own data types for custom instrumentation for your mobile apps. Using these four options, you can get a wide range of data based on your needs for your apps. Custom data options Description Session-level custom attributes In creating your own attributes, consisting of a key-value pair, you can add custom data for use in tracking session data. Custom breadcrumbs Useful for troubleshooting crash causes, custom breadcrumb events track the user's code-level path through the app by seeing which breadcrumb API calls were reached and reporting app status details from those moments. Custom interactions Custom interactions give you tracing power so you can debug method timings and improve network call efficiency. A common use of interactions is to understand the underlying activity associated with loading a particular app screen. Custom events You can instrument custom events to collect data about user activity as a user navigates through your app. That user activity will in turn trigger other data collection: a collection of breadcrumbs, auto-instrumented HTTP requests and errors, auto-instrumented interactions, and custom interactions. Add session-level custom attributes Custom attributes annotate (or \"tag\") your mobile monitoring data. A custom attribute consists of a key-value pair. For example, you might create the key userEmail with values such as alice@bigcorp.test and bob@example.com. The agent automatically attaches custom attributes to default mobile monitoring data, and to any breadcrumbs or custom events you create. You can use custom attributes to capture usage data that's relevant to your business. Common examples include account names or IDs, user emails, and subscription levels. You can then filter and facet in the Crash analysis page and via NRQL query. Setting custom attributes will add the key-value pair information at the session level. All default mobile monitoring events inherit these session-level custom attributes. As a best practice, use custom attributes to track a single value for a key that can be true across a session (for example, a user's subscription level, or whether SAML was used to log in). To track the change of a value over the course of a session, like a change in connection type, you would instead record a breadcrumb and its own custom attributes. To track a series of discrete user actions that occur across the course of a session, use custom events. To add custom attributes, see: Android: Use setAttribute() and incrementAttribute(). iOS: Use setAttribute() and incrementAttribute(). Record breadcrumbs Breadcrumbs track the state of your app as it runs, then report a snapshot of that state if your app crashes. This allows you to debug your mobile app crashes more easily. Custom interactions only inherit custom attributes created at the session level. Breadcrumbs will inherit those same session-level custom attributes, but optionally you can also report additional custom attributes specific to each recordBreadcrumb() API call. You can use breadcrumbs in several ways: You could record a breadcrumb event when your app receives an HTTP response, and also record the values in that response as custom attributes (for example, the response might tell the app what screen to display next or recording unique timestamps for each change in the course of a session). If the app crashes or throws errors, you will be able to see invalid data from the HTTP response. You could track the success of each step of your user login process, with perhaps a status attribute recording a success or failure key for each step. This would let you debug which step is causing issues. Once you have released a version of your app that creates MobileBreadcrumb custom events, you can see them in the crash event trail whenever they appear in the app's code path as part of a crashed session. You can also query them using NRQL and query either all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs from crashed sessions. This lets you see the frequency of app paths that include that particular breadcrumb. To add custom breadcrumbs, see: Android: Use recordBreadcrumb(). iOS: Use recordBreadcrumb(). Create custom interactions Our mobile monitoring agent begins instrumenting an interaction when it detects a screen load or partial screen load (such as fragments for Android or view controllers for iOS). New Relic automatically traces slow interactions, providing a complete, in-depth picture of a single slow interaction, including the methods that were called, what network requests were made, and the CPU and memory usage once that interaction started. Our mobile monitoring automatically selects data-rich traces. The specific criteria the agent looks for are interactions whose instrumented methods account for at least 30% of the overall interaction time. In addition to the auto-instrumentation, you can start a custom interaction to force the agent to start recording a trace beginning at that point in your app code and continuing across the subsequent methods and network calls. Custom interaction traces provide deep information. However, they increase the overhead of the agent compared to other custom data collection methods because of the large amount of data collected for the entire duration of an interaction. When associated with a crash, custom interactions show up in the crash event trail. You can also query them with NRQL for flexible analysis. Interactions are powerful for tracing but are less flexible in other ways than other custom data types: While custom breadcrumbs and custom events let you optimize your custom attributes to specific events, interactions can only inherit session-level attributes. You can also manually end a custom interaction. However, ensure that the interaction includes enough method activity to be recorded. If the agent does not detect any traced activity for 0.5 seconds, the agent stops the interaction tracing because it is assumed no interesting data remains. In addition, the agent can only trace one interaction at a time, so if a new interaction is triggered the current trace will automatically be stopped in preference for the new trace. To add custom interaction traces, see: Android: Use startInteraction() and endInteraction(). iOS: Create and complete interactions. You can also configure interaction tracing globally: Android: Disable entirely with withInteractionTracing(), or disable only auto-instrumented traces with withDefaultInteractions(). iOS: Disable entirely with NRFeatureFlag_InteractionTracing(), or disable only auto-instrumented traces with NRFeatureFlag_DefaultInteractions(). Record custom events Custom events are a powerful tool for reporting arbitrary user activity to New Relic. When associated with a crash, custom events show up in the crash event trail. You can also query them with NRQL for flexible analysis. Unlike custom interactions, custom events allow you to add custom attributes to a particular event within the user session. For example, you could record a custom event each time a user taps a button or accesses a certain feature, and then use NRQL to track how often that feature was used. Beyond a simple count, you can FACET on default mobile app attributes such as location, device, or carrier to analyze usage. Adding session-level custom attributes would let you further examine usage based on the criteria important to you, such as user subscription level or other user characteristics. Adding additional attributes for that custom event would allow you to track user behavior more closely: What data did they enter or what option did they select, for example. To add custom events, see: Android: Use recordCustomEvent(). iOS: Use recordCustomEvent().",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. When you use Insights to make queries, NRQL does not have an equivalent SQL-like JOIN function for subqueries. Recommendation: Make the transition from Insights to New Relic One so that you can take advantage of nested queries. Simulate SQL JOIN in Insights If you are using Insights to gain more in-depth data, you can add custom attributes to some data types. With Insights, you can simulate a JOIN by using custom attributes in a query's WHERE or FACET clause. Example: You want to know which browser types are experiencing the highest web duration for a specific product purchase. You could add a custom attribute named Product to your application's purchase transaction method. Then you could run this NRQL query: SELECT max(duration), average(duration), max(backendDuration), average(backendDuration) FROM PageView WHERE Product = 'Hat' FACET userAgentName SINCE 7 days ago Copy",

      "info": "Learn how to provision New Relic resources using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).",
      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "The second version of our StatsD integration was released on May 25 2020. It's an improvement on our first StatsD integration. Improvements include: simpler configuration, and a simpler method for adding tags (key-value pairs). Features Our StatsD integration (version 2) lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ _ NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' _ address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: Remember to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

      "body": "Golden metrics and golden tags are bits of information about an entity that we consider to be the most important for that entity. We use this information to display a brief overview of an entity across all New Relic. You can see and contribute to the standard definitions of the golden metrics and tags in this public repository. This document explains how to query an entity's custom metrics using NerdGraph. Tip For more on how to query entities using the NerdGraph API, see our tutorial. Fetch golden metrics When fetching golden metrics for a specific GUID or list of GUIDS, the provided queries are already filtered for you. You can run the resulting query as is in the query builder. The resulting metric can be either a timeseries or a single value. Here's an example of one golden metric query for an AWS DynamoDB table entity with the GUID ExampleGUID. SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('ExampleGUID') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' TIMESERIES Copy You can use NerdGraph to query for the golden metrics of a specific entity; for example: { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenMetrics {   metrics { query title   } } } } } Copy Fetch golden tags Golden tags are always represented the same way, whether requested by GUID or by entityType. You will always receive the list of tag keys considered the most important about the entity. { actor { entity(guid: \"ENTITY-GUID\") { goldenTags { tags { key } } } } } Copy Customize golden metrics and golden tags If you want to change the golden metrics and golden tags based on the specificities of your environment, you can override them in two different contexts, in your account, or in a workload. Override golden metrics or golden tags for a specific entity type in your whole account In this case, the new golden metrics or the new golden tags will be applied in all New Relic One, converting your new metrics and tags as the default for the specified entity type. To do that, you can use a NerdGraph mutation to override the golden metrics for a specific entity. mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from. In this case, you should set the account that you want to override. metrics: The new NRDB query will be shown as golden metrics. eventId: The field used to filter the entity in the metric. How the entity GUID is defined in your event. select: The SELECT clause of the NRDB query. This field is required. from: The FROM clause of the NRDB query. where: Complementary where clause to identify the entity type field. facet: The field to FACET. title: The title of the golden metric. This field is optional. name: The name of the golden metric. This field is required. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy The metrics input object defines the parts of an NRDB query, split into sections. One of these sections is the eventId, which is used to identify the field that defines the GUID inside the NRDB Event you want to use as a golden metric. For example: SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average) FROM DatastoreSample WHERE entityGuid IN ('EntityGuid') AND provider='DynamoDbTable' FACET entityName TIMESERIES Copy It's defined as follows: { eventId: \"entityGuid\", from: \"DatastoreSample\", where: \"provider='DynamoDbTable'\", facet: \"entityName\", select: \"average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average)\", name: GetItem latency (ms), title: GetItem latency (ms) } Copy As you can see in the resultant object, the where clause only contains the provider field. The system adds the where clause with the eventId field by default. You can do the same for the golden tags using this NerdGraph mutation: mutation { entityGoldenTagsOverride( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, tags: [{key: \"applicationName\"} , {key: \"environment\"} ]) { errors { message type } tags { context { account } domainType { domain type } tags { key } } } } Copy Override golden metrics from a particular entity type in a workload New Relic's workloads provide an aggregated view of health and performance data about a group of entities. The time series charts shown for each entity type in a workload are defined by the golden metrics in the workload account. If you want to further customize which time series to show for a specific entity type in a particular workload, override the golden metrics in the account with the following mutation: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}, metrics: [ {eventId: EVENT_ID, select: NRDB_QUERY_SELECT, from: NRDB_QUERY_EVENT, where: NRDB_QUERY_WHERE, title: TITLE_OF_THE_METRIC, facet: FACET, name: NAME_OF_THE_METRIC}, ...]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy See above for details on each field. In this case, context is the workload's GUID. Override an APM application mutation { entityGoldenMetricsOverride( context: {guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}, domainType: {domain: \"APM\", type: \"APPLICATION\"}, metrics: [ {eventId: \"entity.guid\", from: \"Transaction\", name: \"cpuUsage\", select: \"max(cpuUsage)\", title: \"CPU Usage\"}, {eventId: \"guid\", from: \"Metric\", where: \"metricTimesliceName in ('HttpDispatcher', 'OtherTransaction/all')\", facet: \"appName\", select: \"count(newrelic.timeslice.value)\", name: \"throughput\", title: \"Throughput\"}]) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Fetch the custom golden metrics and golden tags The queries defined in the previous sections always return the default golden metrics and golden tags. If you want to fetch your custom golden metrics or golden tags, you need to send the context defined in the query, for example: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenMetrics( context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { metrics { title query name } } } } } Copy For golden tags: { actor { entity(guid: INFRA-AWSDYNAMODBTABLE-GUID) { goldenTags(context: {account: ACCOUNT_ID, guid: WORKLOAD_ENTITY_GUID}) { tags { key } } } } } Copy You can send both contexts simultaneously for querying, if your metrics or tags have the context inside the workload. The API returns the most specific golden metric or golden tags based on the context that you defined in the requests. The priority is workload and account. Reset custom metrics and golden tags If your custom golden metrics are not relevant to you any more, you can restore the defaults defined by New Relic. In the context parameter, set the desired account or workload guid (in the guid parameter). To restore your golden metrics in an account, run this query: mutation { entityGoldenMetricsReset( context: {guid: ACCOUNT_TO_OVERRIDE_GOLDEN_METRICS}, domainType: {domain: DOMAIN, type: TYPE}) { errors { message type } metrics { context { account guid } domainType { domain type } metrics { definition { eventId facet from select where } name query title } } } } Copy Where: domainType: The entity type of the metrics to override. context: The context to fetch the golden metrics from.

This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove.

The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team.

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the entity explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Entity explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the entity explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Read the overview: Use tags to organize and group what you monitor. Follow these instructions for creating tags: NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, apps monitored by New Relic APM or New Relic Browser, hosts monitored by New Relic Infrastructure, and so on) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access Important This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools.

NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. New Relic provides a powerful GraphQL tool to explore the API with embedded schema definitions. To get started, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Tip For sample queries and mutations, use our NerdGraph tutorials. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Tip To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys.

The agent now reports the gRPC status code rather than \"translating\" to HTTP status codes. Vert.x The Java agent now provides visibility into your applications built using the Vert.x 3.8. The agent instruments Vert.x Web, Vert.x Core, and Vert.x HTTP client. With this instrumentation, the agent will identify and name your transactions based on Vert.x web routing paths. The agent will also time web handlers, track async handlers, and external calls made with Vert.x HTTP client. XML custom instrumentation The custom XML instrumentation XSD has been enhanced to support now include support for specifying leaf tracers. Class Histogram A new Class Histogram extension is now available to report heap memory details as events. Jedis Added support for Jedis 3.0.0 and higher. You can now see your Jedis calls in breakdowns in the overview chart, entries in the Databases tab, and segments in transaction traces. Lettuce Instrumentation modules for Lettuce 4 and 5 are now available via the Java agent incubator. New OSS SDK We now have an open source Telemetry SDK for Java for sending telemetry data to New Relic. The current SDK supports sending dimensional metrics to the Metric API and spans to the Trace API. Fixes The Solr 7 instrumentation would not report Update JMX metrics. HttpURLConnection instrumentation produced External metrics only when network methods (getInputStream, getResponseCode) are called. MongoDB instrumentation would report duplicate metrics when applications invoked MongoClientOptions.build() more than once.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on.

Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts.

Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic PHP agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying a single PHP application via Debian. For best results with the GAE flex environment, always use Debian. For more information about deploying and configuring your PHP app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for PHP Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a PHP app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the New Relic PHP agent for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for PHP to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Extend the GAE image for PHP In this example, the Dockerfile extends the generic PHP image with application files for a single application in Debian. You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command. FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/php:latest ENV DOCUMENT_ROOT /app RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update; DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install wget sudo RUN wget -O - https://download.newrelic.com/548C16BF.gpg | sudo apt-key add - RUN echo 'deb http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/ newrelic non-free' | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic.list RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install newrelic-php5 RUN NR_INSTALL_KEY=\"new-relic-license-key\" NR_INSTALL_SILENT=true newrelic-install install Copy 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom runtime_config: document_root: . Copy 4. Build a Docker image The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. When building the Docker image, use the PHP image from Google App Engine. Standard Docker images from other providers may cause problems with GAE. To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy --project php-app-name Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the New Relic APM Overview page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic PHP agent logs to the Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.yml file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

This document explains how to report your own custom events and attributes. Value from custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. By reporting custom events, you can create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data. This is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Learn about our Infinite Tracing feature, which is available with some of our tracing tools. Use: View your traces in the UI after you enable distributed tracing. Trace requests across apps and services While APM transaction tracing is helpful for analyzing calls in a single application, distributed tracing broadens your view by showing the path a request takes across multiple applications and services, from start to finish. With this wider view, you can quickly troubleshoot performance bottlenecks and errors. As requests travel between services, each segment is recorded as a span, which represents time spent in services or resources of those services. All the spans of a request are combined into a single distributed trace to give you a picture of an entire request. Once your traces are captured in New Relic, here’s what you can do: What you can do How it works with distributed tracing See the user experience If you enable distributed tracing for browser monitoring, you can tie that client/user experience to the backend code. You can understand which users are affected by a backend error or code change. Track your lambda functions If you enable distributed tracing for your lambda functions, serverless code will be connected to all of your other code as it executes. Detect anomalous spans Spans that are slow in comparison to typical behavior are marked as anomalous, with charts comparing them to typical performance. See your errors and logs Frontend and backend errors appear right in the context of your traces. Everything you need to troubleshoot is in one place. Filter results You can filter charts using many data points, so you can analyze trace data in different ways.

Go to the New Relic University tutorial Intro to New Relic NerdGraph. Or, go to the full online course New Relic APIs. NerdGraph terminology The New Relic GraphQL server explicitly defines the graph structure of NerdGraph. The following keywords are common to all GraphQL servers. Use these keywords to help build and understand your own queries. In addition: To understand how NerdGraph provides unified access to all the things you monitor with New Relic, see NerdGraph entities. To understand schema definitions: From the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, select Docs. Term Definition Queries Queries are basic requests that are intended to only fetch data, without any additional actions. Queries in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations Mutations are requests that are intended to have additional actions, such as creating data or updating data on a server. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Make queries with the explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. In GraphQL, you ask for specific information in the graph structure of New Relic's data. You can follow the nodes of the graph to query exactly the data that you want. New fields are added seamlessly, and old fields can be marked as deprecated, which removes them from documentation and allows an eventual, graceful shutdown of that field. Query account a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one NerdGraph GraphiQL request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "Alerts lets you set up robust and customizable alert policies for anything that you can monitor. Receive notifications for fluctuations in key performance metrics as data streams in from all of our products, including APM, Infrastructure, Browser, Mobile, and NRQL queries. Tip To use Alerts and Applied Intelligence, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Build a comprehensive alerting solution Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Alerts & AI > Create condition: This shows the threshold-setting UI page when creating an alert condition. We give you control over every part of creating a robust alerting solution for your applications and architecture: Decision Steps Decide what to monitor. You can set up alert conditions for any monitored data source. Whether your architecture has just a few components or many, you'll be able to create an effective alerting solution. Define how it will be monitored. You can define exactly what data source behavior opens a violation. Unique features include: Extensive control over the time and frequency settings that opens a violation and a notification. Set critical thresholds for obvious performance problems and optional warning thresholds for when behavior is approaching critical. Baseline alert conditions that automatically adjust to your system's behavior. You decide how sensitive you want the thresholds to be. Decide how incidents are generated. To reduce notification fatigue, incident preference settings give you control over how notifications are created. For example, you may want to receive a notice for every violation or only want a single notification for a series of consecutive violations. Decide how notifications are sent. We offer customizable notification channels via many common services, including email, mobile push notifications, OpsGenie, Slack, and more. To see supported services, see Notification channels. Unique, intelligent features Besides the standard controls you'd expect from a complete alerting solution, we offer some unique and powerful features, including: Feature Details Self-adjusting monitoring Baseline alert conditions allow you to create intelligent, self-adjusting conditions. Anomaly detection An anomalous behavior indicator automatically detects when a violation has occurred within a few minutes of major changes in key database or external service activity. Detect outliers from group behavior Use outlier detection to detect when one or more data sources in a defined group deviate from the behavior you expect from that group. Custom query conditions Using our NRQL query language, create a customized query, and then monitor the results of that query for deviations over time. NerdGraph API Use our GraphQL NerdGraph API to interact with alerts. We recommend the NerdGraph API over the REST API because it has the latest features. Alerts REST API Use the REST API to return information about your alert settings or to create alert policies and conditions. We recommend you start with the NerdGraph API to see if it has the options you need. Webhooks Customizable webhooks allow you to define custom headers, basic authentication, custom payloads, and more. Incident scoping and rollups Every alert policy can be configured to use one of three violation grouping strategies to control the number of alert incidents created, and therefore the number of notifications sent. Cross-product events A dedicated Events page that shows operational events across all of your products. Data security and privacy By default, Alerts doesn't record any personal data. In addition, it automatically sets default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information about our security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit our security website. What's next?

      "body": "In case you haven’t heard, NerdGraph is New Relic’s unified API in a GraphQL flavor. The new dashboards API follows this unified approach and is exposed through NerdGraph for user consumption. Why a new dashboards API? Dashboards in New Relic embrace the entity concept and are now an entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Dashboards can now connect with any other type of entity for better observability solutions, which opens the door to endless opportunities we would like you to benefit from. At the same time, we have built new features for dashboards: All New Relic One dashboards are structured in pages, known as Data Apps in Insights Multiple queries from different accounts within the same widget Facet linking Facet linking with support for cases From REST endpoints to GraphQL queries/mutations One of the main benefits from a GraphQL API is that it provides a complete and understandable description of the APIs' data. By using NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. You can list all the dashboard entities you have access to: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy You can list all the dashboards by name: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy You can list all the dashboards by the creator’s email: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy You can list all the dashboards by the creator’s userId: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type = 'DASHBOARD' and ownerId = \"2357322\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity GUID. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. In the example below we are only interested in the entity GUID and the name of our dashboard. { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid name } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example below is not complete but can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard GUID and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example is not complete but it can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardUpdate( guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\", dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity GUID. mutation { dashboardDelete { status errors { type description } } } Copy Errors as first class citizens As you might have noticed, all dashboard mutations offer you a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem. mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } Copy",

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

In the general configuration section, set ${variable.property} placeholders that will be automatically replaced by the properties of the secret object. The secret object can be defined as a simple string or json object. Important If the secrets retrieval fails, the integration won't be executed, as the infrastructure agent does not have all the data it requires to execute. For example, the following configuration will retrieve an object named creds from Vault (you can define the object's name for the secret.) Let's assume that the stored object is a valid JSON with a property named user and another property named password. We want to use them to set the basic HTTP credentials of the status_url property from an Nginx on-host integration: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Tip Both simple strings and valid JSON objects can be retrieved from variables. When using JSON objects make sure both keys and values are enclosed with double-quotes. Using environment variables Environment variables can be used into the variables section with the {{MY_ENV_VAR}} notation. When doing so, environment variables are expanded and their value is replaced at runtime. Use this method to avoid having sensitive values such as tokens or obfuscation keys included in the configuration file. When using environment variables in on-host integration configuration files the passthrough_environment setting must be defined. Secrets variables Define secrets in each configuration under a variables section. Each entry is a user-defined secret name that will store the properties of the retrieved secrets. Each variable can contain the following properties: YAML key Description ttl Type: String Amount of time before a secret is refreshed. This can be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h). Examples: 30s, 10m, 1h Default: 1h aws-kms AWS KMS secret retrieval configuration vault Vault secret retrieval configuration cyberark-cli CyberArk command line interface configuration cyberark-api CyberArk REST API configuration obfuscated New Relic CLI obfuscation AWS KMS secrets To retrieve your secrets from Amazon KMS, you can set the following properties in your aws-kms section. Not all fields are required. For example, you will need either data, file, or http to provide the encoded KMS string. YAML key Description data Type: String Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt file Type: String Path to file containing Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt http Type: YAML properties HTTP configuration to use to request Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt. For more information, see Vault http. credential_file Type: String Path to AWS credentials file config_file Type: String Path to AWS config file region Type: String AWS KMS region type Type: String (plain, equal, or json) Secret value format: plain: a raw string to be stored directly into the destination variable. equal: a key=property one-line string to be stored as object properties into the destination variable. json: a JSON object to be stored as properties into the destination variable. Secrets of type plain or json use dot notation; for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. The following example will allow retrieving a plain password string from AWS KMS. It must be decrypted from the provided data encoded string. variables: myPassword: aws-kms: data: T0hBSStGTEVY region: ap-southeast-2 credential_file: \"./my-aws-credentials-file\" config_file: \"./my-aws-config-file\" type: plain Copy Vault secrets Vault must enable an http field containing the HTTP configuration used to connect to Vault. The http entry can contain the following entries: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers tls_config properties Important Secrets must use dot notation, for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. YAML key Description enable Type: Boolean Enable TLS Default: false insecure_skip_verify Type: Boolean Skip verifying server’s certificate chain and host Default: false min_version Type: UInt16 The minimum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.0) max_version Type: UInt16 The maximum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.3) ca Type: String TLS certificate \"\" The following example will retrieve a secret using a Vault token from a secured server, and skip the server certificates verification: variables: mydata: vault: http: url: https://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy CyberArk command line interface To retrieve secrets from the CyberArk command line interface (CLI) use the following configuration, all keys are required YAML Key Description cli Type: string Full path to the CyberArk CLI executable Default: \"\" app-id Type: string Application id of the secret holder Default: \"\" safe Type: string Safe containing the secret Default: \"\" folder Type: string Folder containing the secret Default: \"\" object Type: string The object the secret is associated with Default: \"\" The following example will retrieve a CyberArk secret using the command line interface: variables: credentials: cyberark-cli: cli: /full/path/to/clipasswordsdk app-id: my-appid safe: my-safe folder: my-folder object: my-object Copy CyberArk REST API To retrieve secrets using the CyberArk REST API there must be a http key containing the HTTP configuration. The http key contains these sub-keys, only url is required: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from, this key is required Default: none tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers The following example will retrieve a secret using the CyberArk REST API, skipping server certificate verification: variables: credentials: cyberark-api: http: url: https://hostname/AIMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=myAppID&Query=Safe=mySafe;Object=myObject tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy New Relic CLI Obfuscation Important We recommend using any of the supported secrets providers instead of the simple obfuscation when possible. See our guidelines below to define environment variables to avoid having the obfuscation key in configuration files. Tip Infrastructure Agent 1.14.0 or above is required You can use the New Relic CLI obfuscate command to obscure sensitive information in the infrastructure agent or any on-host integration configuration file. Steps: Install the New Relic CLI on any host (it can be your development host). Run the CLI obfuscate command in order to generate the obfuscated value: newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '<plain_text_config_value>' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy Copy the result of the cli command into the text argument in the obfuscated section as shown in the examples below. YAML key Description key Type: String The string used when obfuscating the clear-text value using New Relic CLI Default: none secret Type: String The output of the newrelic-cli command Default: none Integrations configuration example The following example will allow retrieving the Nginx user and password that has been obfuscated using the New Relic CLI: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy It's recommended to use environment variables for the obfuscation arguments as shown in the example below: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: {{OBFUSCATION_KEY}} secret: {{OBFUSCATION_TEXT}} instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy Agent configuration example This example allows retrieving a string that contains the proxy details (user, password and host): variables: obfuscated_proxy: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' proxy: ${obfuscated_proxy} Copy",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

      "info": "Learn how to provision New Relic resources using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).",
      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

In either case, all props are 1:1 compatible with the <NrqlQuery> format type CHART. A common case to render one row per NRQL facet, is to perform the query outside of the table, then pass the result as items (returned data from a <NrqlQuery> is an array, that can be directly used as the input items of a table).

Table can only contain as children <TableHeader> and a function returning <TableRow>s. function () => undefined classNamestring Appends class names to the component. Should be used only for positioning and spacing purposes. compactboolean DEFAULT false Establishes whether the table should render in compact mode (compact mode has narrower rows). In general, use the standard mode, since compact is reserved for data representation, e.g. in a dashboard. itemsany[] DEFAULT [] The items to be used when rendering. They are required when rendering items with a render callback. Each item can have any structure and type possible, and will the corresponding one will be provided when rendering each element list. mainColumnnumber DEFAULT 0 Column containing the main data identifying the row. Often the first column (index 0) is the relevant one, but actions (like favorites) could be placed before it. onLoadMorefunction Callback fired when more items must be loaded. This happens when you're lazy loading the items and the items that are about to render cannot be found in the items array. This callback should be used to fetch/load the missing items from the backend or other sources. The returned Promise should be resolved once item data has finished loading. It will be used to determine when to refresh the list with the newly-loaded data. This callback may be called multiple times in reaction to a single scroll event. function ( cursor : {Object // Items to load. ) => undefined onSelectfunction Function called when the user clicks over a row checkbox. It is called with the event of the checkbox, as well as with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. When the user selects or unselects the header checkbox (select / unselect all), the callback will be called once for every item, representing individual clicks over each row. The header checkbox state is automatically controlled by the table. function () => undefined rowCountnumber Number of rows. By default it's equal to length of array passed in the items prop. You should specify the rowCount when you know the total number of items but you want to lazy load them while scrolling. selectedfunction Function that returns whether a row is selected. It needs to return a boolean representing the state of the row. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. function ( args : {Object ) => undefined spacingTypeenum[] Spacing property. Spacing is defined as a tuple of zero to four values, which follow the same conventions as CSS properties like margin or padding. To omit a value, use SPACING_TYPE.OMIT. <Array of <One of Table.SPACING_TYPE.EXTRA_LARGE , Table.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE , Table.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM , Table.SPACING_TYPE.NONE , Table.SPACING_TYPE.OMIT , Table.SPACING_TYPE.SMALL , > > styleobject Inline style for custom styling.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the chart builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. Tip To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep.

The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor.

Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries and charts. Now we have New Relic One, which has its own query builder experience. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience compared to Insights. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features Why it's easy to switch to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Improved features in New Relic One New Relic One is an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights. Features include: Better querying and charting experiences, including a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL Better display options that are easier to understand, especially with dense, line-heavy charts and a better TV mode More charts or widgets across dashboards (up to 12 now, instead of Insights' 3-across limit Easier creation of dashboards with multiple pages (previously called data apps in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Improved experience for querying metric data, both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data Easy customization for your visualizations Try out New Relic One It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the recommendations before you do. Then, to view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click Try new dashboards. Recommendations The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation: Important If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards. If you create some types of dashboards in New Relic One, their improved features may lose functionality when edited in Insights. These include: Dashboards created using the Insights metric explorer. When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights. Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One. New customization features result in incompatibilities between New Relic One and Insights charts. Also: Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called Data apps. When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the Data apps section. Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following Manage data UI pages will remain in Insights for now: Summary UI page Add data UI page Embeddables UI page Lookup tables UI page API keys UI page Formatter UI page To find these pages: go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data Learn more For a more detailed look of New Relic One dashboard features, see this Explorers Hub post.

Global Performance data sets data are useful for: Existing New Relic customers who want to gain general monitoring and troubleshooting insights from a curated collection of aggregated, real-world data. Newcomers who want to get a feel for New Relic’s dashboards and data tools and view real data visualizations in order to make informed decisions about how to add their own data to New Relic. This resource provides information about the Global Performance data sets, how they work, what they do, and current options for accessing Global Performance data. Public API Performance dashboard Important Please note: Global Performance data sets are presented as-is. Global Performance data sets represent an aggregate of samples across a range of sources, and New Relic makes no effort to attempt to confirm the correctness, completeness, or veracity of the data. This data should not be relied on as the sole source of information for any purpose you may use it, and New Relic is not responsible for decisions made in reliance on this data. Global Performance data sets should not be viewed as either an endorsement or a recommendation by New Relic of the technologies represented in the data sets. Access valuable data and try out New Relic Our first Global Performance data set, Public API Performance, offers a large body of real-world, real-time data about the performance of public APIs including AWS, Google, and more as experienced by New Relic customers (as authorized). Because this data is already flowing through New Relic, you can access it within seconds of activating your account, and test drive New Relic dashboarding and querying capabilities in the process.

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. For example, let's say you query your applications, but you don't know which have been migrated to cloud and which haven't. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'On-premises', filter(count(*), WHERE duration < .06) as 'AWS' FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET cases, you can add the condition and obtain the status of the migration: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' facet cases(WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' OR appName = 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts On-Prem', WHERE appName != 'WebPortal' AND appName != 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts in Cloud') since 10 minutes ago limit 100 Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our entity explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the entity explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's guid, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Add a new page. Pages allow you to better organize your dashboards. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. Access the query builder to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator. Get a high density overview of all your entities, grouped by entity type or by tags. Use this to detect any issues and health patterns at a glance. New Relic Lookout. Spot entities that have recent performance deviations. Use this to quickly identify unusual behaviors. Other components include: Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes, and it allows you to see only entities of the selected type, updating the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload.

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account.

Other components include: Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes, and it allows you to see only entities of the selected type, updating the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts.

Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries and charts. Now we have New Relic One, which has its own query builder experience. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience compared to Insights. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features Why it's easy to switch to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Improved features in New Relic One New Relic One is an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights. Features include: Better querying and charting experiences, including a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL Better display options that are easier to understand, especially with dense, line-heavy charts and a better TV mode More charts or widgets across dashboards (up to 12 now, instead of Insights' 3-across limit Easier creation of dashboards with multiple pages (previously called data apps in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Improved experience for querying metric data, both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data Easy customization for your visualizations Try out New Relic One It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the recommendations before you do. Then, to view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click Try new dashboards. Recommendations The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation: Important If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards. If you create some types of dashboards in New Relic One, their improved features may lose functionality when edited in Insights. These include: Dashboards created using the Insights metric explorer. When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights. Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One. New customization features result in incompatibilities between New Relic One and Insights charts. Also: Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called Data apps. When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the Data apps section. Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following Manage data UI pages will remain in Insights for now: Summary UI page Add data UI page Embeddables UI page Lookup tables UI page API keys UI page Formatter UI page To find these pages: go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data Learn more For a more detailed look of New Relic One dashboard features, see this Explorers Hub post.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "In digital business, systems are becoming increasingly large, complex, and interdependent. You have hundreds of applications and services running at the same time, and you need to monitor thousands of elements emitting data (we call those data sources entities). With the New Relic Explorer, we give you a new, efficient front-door experience to easily observe the full stack of your software. We automatically create and maintain visibility from the data you send us. Use the New Relic Explorer to access and give context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, containers, synthetic monitors, etc. You can quickly see the entities related to a problem, exposing possible root causes and what other systems might be affected. Tip To use New Relic One and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With the New Relic Explorer, it’s more than just observing the metrics: understand the root of what’s happening, not just the symptoms. Gain extensive visibility of each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected, at a glance. See all your workloads, and create a new one in a click. Get a high level view of how your system’s doing with the New Relic Navigator. Quickly grasp unusual trends and behaviors with New Relic Lookout. Filter and group related entities to quickly drill down to the issues. Troubleshoot issues with tools that are faster, less cumbersome, and more accurate. Identify areas of improvement, and plan your changes. Want to learn more? See the video (it's only 45 seconds!): Short guide to using the New Relic Explorer. View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator. Get a high density overview of all your entities, grouped by entity type or by tags. Use this to detect any issues and health patterns at a glance. New Relic Lookout. Spot entities that have recent performance deviations. Use this to quickly identify unusual behaviors. Other components include: Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes, and it allows you to see only entities of the selected type, updating the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator. Get a high density overview of all your entities, grouped by entity type or by tags. Use this to detect any issues and health patterns at a glance. New Relic Lookout. Spot entities that have recent performance deviations. Use this to quickly identify unusual behaviors. Other components include: Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes, and it allows you to see only entities of the selected type, updating the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

View of workload components. This is useful for understanding the workload’s architecture, especially if the workload’s entities change over time because they are dynamically defined. Important charts. These are charts with key metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level. Workload status. You can configure the status to inform about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. Open violations. You can filter the workload to only the alerting entities to make it easier to troubleshoot the most important issues. Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. The Entities tab shows the entities that make up the workload.

We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

A more consistent and unified platform Before our release of New Relic One, our platform was separated into various products, like APM, Browser, and Mobile. With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily. For more information, see our New Relic One transition guide. Quickly understand context New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to: Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities in your system. The New Relic Navigator gives you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And the New Relic Lookout shows entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with tags. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. Cross-account access brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find. Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with workloads. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise. Get more context while you query with the query builder which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Know your relationships and dependencies We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. The New Relic Explorer gives you context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, or containers. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Organize everything you monitor and provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the entity explorer by tags or text View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Know which teams are responsible for specific entities across your organization. Create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Query your data more easily At the top of all UI pages, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the NRQL mode query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One.

Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries and charts. Now we have New Relic One, which has its own query builder experience. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience compared to Insights. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features Why it's easy to switch to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Improved features in New Relic One New Relic One is an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights. Features include: Better querying and charting experiences, including a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL Better display options that are easier to understand, especially with dense, line-heavy charts and a better TV mode More charts or widgets across dashboards (up to 12 now, instead of Insights' 3-across limit Easier creation of dashboards with multiple pages (previously called data apps in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Improved experience for querying metric data, both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data Easy customization for your visualizations Try out New Relic One It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the recommendations before you do. Then, to view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click Try new dashboards. Recommendations The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation: Important If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards. If you create some types of dashboards in New Relic One, their improved features may lose functionality when edited in Insights. These include: Dashboards created using the Insights metric explorer. When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights. Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One. New customization features result in incompatibilities between New Relic One and Insights charts. Also: Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called Data apps. When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the Data apps section. Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following Manage data UI pages will remain in Insights for now: Summary UI page Add data UI page Embeddables UI page Lookup tables UI page API keys UI page Formatter UI page To find these pages: go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data Learn more For a more detailed look of New Relic One dashboard features, see this Explorers Hub post.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advance configurations Extend webpack configuration You can use our .extended-webpackrc.js file to extend the webpack 4 configuration. This allows you to add your own aliases, scripts, and configurations when locally serving or deploying your app. Proxy browser setup Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic One. But understanding how this works can help you if you encounter issues (for example, with a proxy or browser setup). When developing, your code is served from your local laptop by using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and will use a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. In order to load third-party code into the platform, (both in development and production), New Relic One uses an <IFRAME>, as well as a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net) to perform the load, relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. For this reason, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where UserId is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform (you can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it). Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where NerdpackUuid is the UUID assigned to your package, and NerdpackGid is zero, or a positive integer (you can use 0|[1-9]\\d+ to discriminate it). Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "info": "How to use charts in your NR1 app.",
      "body": "In your application, you can display data in charts, like those used elsewhere in New Relic's user interface. The New Relic One SDK provides React components for different chart types. Once you decide the kind of data you want to present, either from New Relic or some other source, you supply that data to your chart, using props. Query New Relic data In some cases, you want to fetch data from New Relic's database. For example, you may want to display a line chart which plots the number of transactions your application receives over time. With your chart component, set the accountId and query props to query your New Relic data using NRQL: <LineChart accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" />; Copy Alternatively, you can fetch data with a NrqlQuery and set the data prop: <NrqlQuery accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\"> {({ data }) => <LineChart data={data} />} </NrqlQuery>; Copy If you're looking to visualize New Relic data, such as your web application's response times or your server's throughput, querying data in your charts is the way to go. But what if you want to create charts that aren't focused on New Relic data? The data prop is flexible enough that you can supply any arbitrary data, as long as it matches the standardized format. Craft custom data Whether you use custom data sets or the results of a NrqlQuery, a chart's data prop must be an array of objects where each object has both of the following fields: metadata: Defines how the chart presents its data data: An array of data points that appear on the chart For example, create a chart consisting of a line between two points by supplying two x-y coordinates in its data field: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy This LineChart plots a line between coordinates (0, 0) and (20, 10). Use x-y coordinates for all two-dimensional chart formats. For other formats, which you'll learn more about later, use other types of data points. Because data accepts an array, you can supply two series to the same chart: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'series-2', name: 'My second series', viz: 'main', color: 'red', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 50, }, { x: 20, y: 100, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy In this example, you create a single chart with two series. The first series contains the line from the last example. The second series contains a line between points (0, 50) and (20, 100). When using two series in a single chart, like this, you may want to define how the chart represents each series. Use metadata to define those elements. Metadata A series's metadata defines certain features of the series, itself, such as how it should be displayed in your chart. metadata consists of the following attributes: Attribute Description id The series's identifier. Two series having the same id are considered the same series, regardless of where they are located. In general, use a unique id for each series. However, if you use the same series for multiple charts, keeping the id consistent can help with some cross-chart functionality, like simultaneously highlighting multiple charts. name The series's name. name is used in legends, tooltips, and other areas to indicate which series you’re looking at. color The series's color. Most visualizations use this value to differentiate series. Some visualizations, like BillboardChart or JsonChart, ignore it. Use any valid CSS color representation, such as #RRGGBB, hsl(HHH, SS%, LL%), or rgba(RR, GG, BB, .AA). Avoid tweaking the alpha value, when possible, because charts use alpha to highlight or dim certain series. viz The series's visual style. While you most often use main, this field accepts several options: main: Show the series based on chart's type. For instance, a LineChart shows the series as a line, and an AreaChart shows the series as an area. line: Show the series as a line, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to AreaChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. area: Show the series as an area, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to LineChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. event: Show the series as an event, regardless of the chart's type. Charts represent an event as a vertical area behind the main visualization. Events are often used to show alerts. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. target-line: Show the series as a vertical line. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. units_data You can assign a unit type to each axis on a chart. The chart will present data according to the unit type you set with units_data. To set unit_data, pass a JSON object with maps the axis to one of the following unit types: UNKNOWN: The chart displays the series with no special units. COUNT: Each value in the chart represents a count. The chart formats values with their International System prefix. For example, \"k\" represents thousands, \"M\" represents millions, and \"G\" represents billions. PERCENTAGE: Each value in the chart represents a percentage. Typically, you provide values ranging from 0 to 1. The chart formats a value of 1 as \"100%\", a value of 2 as \"200%\", and a value of 0.01 as \"1%\". MS: Each value in the chart represents some number of milliseconds. The chart represents values higher than 1 as a human-readable time duration. For example, 60000 is represented as \"1 minute\". The chart represents values lower than 1 using SI prefixes. For example, 0.001 is represented as 1 μs. TIMESTAMP: Each value in the chart represents a timestamp, the number milliseconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the UNIX Epoch. The chart formats each value as a date. BITS: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits. The chart formats these values using \"b\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb\". BITS_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits per second. The chart formats these values using \"b/s\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb/s\". BYTES: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes. The chart formats these values using \"B\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB\". BYTES_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes per second. The chart formats these values using \"B/s\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB/s\". So, to represent the y-axis for your series in bits, set the y-value in units_data: { \"units_data\": { \"y\": \"BITS\" } } Data While a data series can contain any arbitrary values, a chart only uses values which adhere to its type. So, create your data points according to the chart type: Series Type Example Description Unidimensional [{ \"y\": 10 }, { \"y\": 20 }] The chart plots data points using y values. Use this format with BarChart, BillboardChart, PieChart, StackedBarChart. Two-dimensional [ { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 30 } ] The chart plots data points using x and y values. Use this format with AreaChart, LineChart, ScatterChart, SparklineChart, Funnel [{ \"label1\": 10, \"label2\": 20 }] The chart plots data according to labels. Use this format with FunnelChart. Table [{ \"jobType\": \"SIMPLE\", \"count\": 18 }] The chart plots data according to table columns. You must specify table columns in the metadata. Use this format with TableChart. Event [ { \"x0\": 0, \"x1\": 5 }, { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 15 } ] The chart plots the event's width based on x0 and x1 values. Histogram [ { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 20, \"y\": 100 }, { \"x0\": 30, \"x1\": 40, \"y\": 150 } ] The chart plots the series's width based on x0 and x1 and height based on y. Use this format with HistogramChart and HeatmapChart. Tip JsonChart is a special case because it processes any valid data. For example, you can set an arbitrary JSON object for the chart's data: const data = { data: [ { id: 1, name: 'Foo', price: 123, tags: ['Bar', 'Eek'], stock: { warehouse: 300, retail: 20, } } ], } <JsonChart data={data} /> Copy Special States In previous sections, you learned that a chart's data is an array of series. But you can use special values to present special chart states: null or undefined: Indicates the chart is “loading” its data. In this state, the chart shows a placeholder data set. []: Indicates there is no data to show. The chart states, \"No chart data available\". Configure your chart As you've seen, you use query or data to supply data to your chart, but you can configure other aspects of your chart, too, such as visual settings and click and hover event listeners. Read the documentation for the chart you're using for more specific information. Chart Groups Under some circumstances, you might want to synchronize events, such as dragging or scrubbing, across multiple charts. To do this, use a ChartGroup. All charts in a ChartGroup synchronize their events: <ChartGroup> <Stack> <StackItem> <LineChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\" /> </StackItem> <StackItem> <AreaChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Synthetics SINCE 1 day ago\" /> </StackItem> </Stack> </ChartGroup>; Copy Ideally, group charts that are conceptually related, and separate charts that are conceptually unrelated. Next Step Read the documentation specific to the chart you'd like to use to learn specifics about that chart's behavior and configuration.",

New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor.

Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries and charts. Now we have New Relic One, which has its own query builder experience. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience compared to Insights. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features Why it's easy to switch to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Improved features in New Relic One New Relic One is an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights. Features include: Better querying and charting experiences, including a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL Better display options that are easier to understand, especially with dense, line-heavy charts and a better TV mode More charts or widgets across dashboards (up to 12 now, instead of Insights' 3-across limit Easier creation of dashboards with multiple pages (previously called data apps in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Improved experience for querying metric data, both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data Easy customization for your visualizations Try out New Relic One It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the recommendations before you do. Then, to view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click Try new dashboards. Recommendations The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation: Important If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards. If you create some types of dashboards in New Relic One, their improved features may lose functionality when edited in Insights. These include: Dashboards created using the Insights metric explorer. When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights. Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One. New customization features result in incompatibilities between New Relic One and Insights charts. Also: Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called Data apps. When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the Data apps section. Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following Manage data UI pages will remain in Insights for now: Summary UI page Add data UI page Embeddables UI page Lookup tables UI page API keys UI page Formatter UI page To find these pages: go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data Learn more For a more detailed look of New Relic One dashboard features, see this Explorers Hub post.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "In digital business, systems are becoming increasingly large, complex, and interdependent. You have hundreds of applications and services running at the same time, and you need to monitor thousands of elements emitting data (we call those data sources entities). With the New Relic Explorer, we give you a new, efficient front-door experience to easily observe the full stack of your software. We automatically create and maintain visibility from the data you send us. Use the New Relic Explorer to access and give context to the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, hosts, containers, synthetic monitors, etc. You can quickly see the entities related to a problem, exposing possible root causes and what other systems might be affected. Tip To use New Relic One and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With the New Relic Explorer, it’s more than just observing the metrics: understand the root of what’s happening, not just the symptoms. Gain extensive visibility of each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected, at a glance. See all your workloads, and create a new one in a click. Get a high level view of how your system’s doing with the New Relic Navigator. Quickly grasp unusual trends and behaviors with New Relic Lookout. Filter and group related entities to quickly drill down to the issues. Troubleshoot issues with tools that are faster, less cumbersome, and more accurate. Identify areas of improvement, and plan your changes. Want to learn more? See the video (it's only 45 seconds!): Short guide to using the New Relic Explorer. View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator. Get a high density overview of all your entities, grouped by entity type or by tags. Use this to detect any issues and health patterns at a glance. New Relic Lookout. Spot entities that have recent performance deviations. Use this to quickly identify unusual behaviors. Other components include: Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes, and it allows you to see only entities of the selected type, updating the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights. Features include: Better querying and charting experiences, including a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL Better display options that are easier to understand, especially with dense, line-heavy charts and a better TV mode More charts or widgets across dashboards (up to 12 now, instead of Insights' 3-across limit Easier creation of dashboards with multiple pages (previously called data apps in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Improved experience for querying metric data, both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data Easy customization for your visualizations Try out New Relic One It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the recommendations before you do. Then, to view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click Try new dashboards. Recommendations The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation: Important If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards. If you create some types of dashboards in New Relic One, their improved features may lose functionality when edited in Insights. These include: Dashboards created using the Insights metric explorer. When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights. Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One. New customization features result in incompatibilities between New Relic One and Insights charts. Also: Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called Data apps. When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the Data apps section. Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following Manage data UI pages will remain in Insights for now: Summary UI page Add data UI page Embeddables UI page Lookup tables UI page API keys UI page Formatter UI page To find these pages: go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data Learn more For a more detailed look of New Relic One dashboard features, see this Explorers Hub post.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Update user type To update a user's type (basic user or full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select a user and edit its type. You can also bulk update user type changes. For more about this, see User type. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important On March 1, 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. Previously these basic users had the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorer's Hub post on basic user changes. On the Users and roles UI page, users on our original user model are categorized by user type (full user or basic user). For how to change this, see Update user type. If you're on New Relic One pricing, the number of full users is a factor in your billing. To learn more, see New Relic One pricing. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics.

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

      "body": "When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Undeploy your app You can also manually undeploy an app. Undeploying an app is detaching a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. Before undeploying, you need to unsubscribe your account from the deployed Nerdpack, then specify the UUID of the Nerdpack you've unsubscribed as the one to undeploy. Step 1 of 3 To get a list of deployed Nerdpacks that your account is subscribed to, run nr1 subscription:list. Step 2 of 3 Copy the UUID of the Nerdpack that you want to unsubscribe and pass it to the nerdpack-id option of the unsubscribe command: nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=<UUID> Copy You should get a result like this: Unsubscribed account <your account ID> from the nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID>. Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe the Nerdpack UUID used in step 2: nr1 nerdpack:undeploy --nerdpack-id=<UUID> -t STABLE Copy You should get the result Undeployed nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID> from the STABLE channel. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

In addition, there is no New Relic profiler log for your .NET app. Important If you are an Azure Websites user experiencing CoCreateInstance errors, get support at support.newrelic.com. Solution To verify whether New Relic has the necessary permissions and resolve the problem, follow these troubleshooting steps. Check for profiler CLSID errors. To verify whether the permissions error is due to profiler errors: Check your application event log for errors like this: NET Runtime version 4.0.30319.296 - Loading profiler failed during CoCreateInstance. Profiler CLSID: '{FF68FEB9-E58A-4B75-A2B8-90CE7D915A26}' Copy Compare the CLSID in the error to New Relic's CLSIDs: 71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41 FF68FEB9-E58A-4B75-A2B8-90CE7D915A26 Copy Do one of the following: If the CLSID does not match, uninstall the other profiler. If the CLSID does match, continue with this procedure to check the profiler logs for CoCreateInstance permissions errors. Verify the New Relic assemblies. To verify that the New Relic assemblies are attached to the w3wp.exe process: On the server where your app is installed, download the Microsoft Windows Sysinternals Process Explorer. Unzip the file and run procexp.exe as an Administrator. Select View > Show Lower Pane, then select View > Lower Pane View > DLLs. Generate some traffic to your app. To update the process list, select View > Refresh Now. In the top pane, select your service or w3wp instance (typically nested under a svchost.exe process). In the bottom pane, look for assemblies whose names begin with NewRelic, including: NewRelic.Agent.Core.dll NewRelic.Profiler.dll NewRelic.Agent.IL.dll NewRelic.ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll NewRelic.Json.dll NewRelic.Log.dll Copy If you do not find any assemblies, get support at support.newrelic.com Verify the w3wp.exe environment details. Verify that the w3wp.exe environment details are this: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\ Copy Check for profiler logs. Check for profiler logs in %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs. Make sure there are no profiler logs for the web app you are troubleshooting. If you have a simple or default site installation, ignore any profiler logs for other web apps. Resolve the permissions error. If all the above conditions are present, you have a permissions error. Use any of these options to resolve the permissions error as applicable: Available options Resolve permissions errors Set permissions for the Everyone group. Adjust permissions in the following folders for the Everyone group to give the group all permissions except Full Control: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\ Copy C:\\Program Files (x86)\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\ Copy Set permissions for individual users. If your security policies do not allow adjusting permissions for the Everyone group, then adjust permissions for individual users. Record the users under which your application runs, then adjust permissions for each of those users. Set permissions using the PowerShell script. To add permissions to HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\New Relic by using the PowerShell script: $key = \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\New Relic\" $acl = Get-Acl $key $AddACL = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.RegistryAccessRule (\"Everyone\",\"FullControl\",\"ObjectInherit,ContainerInherit\",\"None\",\"Allow\") $acl.SetAccessRule($AddACL) $acl |Set-Acl -Path $key Copy For 32-bit apps, the path would be HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\New Relic",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results New Relic Insights NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in both New Relic One and New Relic Insights. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

      "body": "Most data generated by integrations is available in New Relic One dashboards, where you can query your data using NRQL and build custom dashboards. The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK. For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see Understand integration data. Get started with integration data Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic: From the one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries. Use the data explorer or the dashboards to explore and understand the available data. Read the documentation for a specific integration to learn about the reported data. When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your Insights dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric over the past day, faceted by displayName: select average('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') from BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' AND providerAccountId = '72' facet displayName TIMESERIES SINCE 1 day ago Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by name: SELECT average(activeMessages) from AzureServiceBusTopicSample TIMESERIES 5 minutes since 6 hours ago FACET displayName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours: SELECT sum('functionExecutionCount.Total') FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample WHERE providerAccountId = '125' SINCE 6 hour ago TIMESERIES auto FACET displayName Copy Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT count(*) FROM AzureVirtualMachineSample SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO WHERE provider = 'AzureVirtualMachine' TIMESERIES Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average('requestsPerSecond') as 'Requests' FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES until 1 minutes ago Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing active MySQL connections over time: SELECT average('connectionsActive') as 'Active Connections' FROM MysqlSample TIMESERIES until 1 minutes ago Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) from InfrastructureEvent where format='inventoryChange' facet changeType since 1 day ago Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Integration event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period.

You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer.

The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. For example, let's say you query your applications, but you don't know which have been migrated to cloud and which haven't. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'On-premises', filter(count(*), WHERE duration < .06) as 'AWS' FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET cases, you can add the condition and obtain the status of the migration: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' facet cases(WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' OR appName = 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts On-Prem', WHERE appName != 'WebPortal' AND appName != 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts in Cloud') since 10 minutes ago limit 100 Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers. This fix brings the Java Agent into compliance with the behavior of other New Relic Agents. Fixes an issue in which custom Hystrix Commands that are subclassed multiple times in Groovy cause an application to throw an exception on startup.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the first call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

Contents Monitor mobile app performance The New Relic Unity plugin allows Unity developers to embed a New Relic Mobile agent (iOS or Android) in a Unity app build for mobile devices to monitor your app's performance. The plugin is written in C#, but it includes the native iOS and Android agents that embed the appropriate files for your build. Features New Relic Mobile Features Comprehensive performance data View your mobile app's performance Overview page for summary information about active sessions, or drill down to detailed information, including (note limitations below): Interaction times and trace details Crash reporting Devices Operating systems Detailed network views Available by using the API to track custom network requests For iOS apps, receive automatic instrumentation for networking for any parts of the app that are native and non-Unity (using standard Apple networking components such as NSURLConnection) Examine HTTP errors and network failures (such as DNS lookups, timeouts, SSL errors, etc.) and server error traces. Usage details at a glance Compare performance between versions of your app with detailed information for memory, CPU (iOS only), interaction speed, network requests per minute, and network failures. View a monthly report with a bar chart tracking the number of devices running your app for each month over the last year. Mobile SDK API options Use the Unity API to: Create and complete interactions Record custom metrics Send custom events to Insights Track custom network requests Known limitations The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument interactions. You must use the Unity API to track specific interactions. The New Relic Unity plugin does not automatically instrument network requests. You must use the Unity API to track network calls. Android builds: Unity still generates an Eclipse project, but Android Studio can import the Eclipse project. Install and configure The Unity plugin includes iOS and Android agent files that will embed the appropriate files for your build. To instrument interactions and network requests, you must use the Unity API to manually instrument your code. Install the Unity plugin As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile project you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your Unity application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to rpm.newrelic.com/mobile. From the mobile apps index, select Add a new app. From the Get started page, select Unity as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile project, then select Continue. Continue with the procedures to configure the Unity plugin. Configure the Unity plugin These procedures to configure your app also appear on the Get started page in the New Relic UI. Install NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage into your project by going to Assets > Import package > Custom package... and selecting NewRelic-Unity-Plugin.unitypackage. Create a new GameObject in your project's initial scene by going to GameObject > Create empty and naming it NewRelicAgent. Add NewRelicAgent.cs script (located in Assets/Plugins) to the NewRelicAgent GameObject: Drag it on top of NewRelicAgent in the Hierarchy tab. OR Click Add Component button, then select New Relic Agent from the Scripts option. In the Inspector tab, set the iOS or Android application token from your New Relic Mobile apps. (Recommendation: Keep New Relic Mobile apps on separate platforms.) Build for your platform (iOS or Android), then open the resulting project (Xcode or Eclipse). For Eclipse, import the generated project into Android Studio. Android only: Ensure that your app requests the INTERNET permission through the Player Settings inspector window. In Other Settings, Configuration, ensure the Internet access dropdown is set to Required. This will result in the following permission added to the app's manifest: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" /> Run your app in an emulator or device to generate data. Check New Relic Mobile to ensure the data is reporting to your account. Configure crash reporting The New Relic Unity plugin cannot automatically upload dSYMs for iOS crash reporting. You must manually upload dSYMs once your iOS unity app is built for release. If the application is bitcode enabled, follow the procedures for bitcode enabled apps once the your iOS app is submitted to Apple. If you are building an Android app with ProGuard enabled, you must follow similar steps. The ProGuard mapping must be uploaded to New Relic so crash reports can be de-obfuscated. For more information, see Android agent crash reporting. Optional: Change the logging level Six logging levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: NONE ERROR WARNING INFO VERBOSE DEBUG Recommendation: Set the logging level from the Unity Inspector tab. Use Unity SDK API Use the New Relic Unity SDK API to further configure and extend the plugin's instrumentation. Create and complete interactions To start an interaction: string interactionIdentifier = NewRelicAgent.StartInteractionWithName(\"new interaction\"); Copy To stop the current interaction: NewRelicAgent.StopCurrentInteraction(interactionIdentifier); Copy Interactions work in conjuction with method tracing. To trace a method insert startTracingMethod, insert at the start of the method to trace, and insert endTracingMethodWithTimer at each exit point of the method. To start tracing a method: Timer methodTimer = new Timer(); NewRelicAgent.StartTracingMethod(\"MethodName\",\"ClassName\",methodTimer,NewRelicAgent.NRTraceType.None); Copy To end tracing a method, use the same timer as the startTracingMethod:> NewRelicAgent.EndTracingMethodWithTimer(methodTimer); Copy Set a custom build identifier Custom build identifiers are set as the Application Build property in the inspector pane for the NewRelicAgent game object, under the New Relic Agent (Script) settings. Execute a demo crash If you have trouble getting your project to crash, use the New Relic Unity plugin API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add this line of code to a button click event handler as applicable: NewRelicAgent.CrashNow(\"message\")> Copy Record custom metrics With the custom metric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events. Custom metrics can help to track high level events specific to your application. You can use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. To create a custom metric, use this method: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category) Copy The name parameter is the textual name of the metric that will appear in the user interface for New Relic Mobile. Using clear, concise metric names will help you get the most out of the metrics. The guidelines for naming a custom metric include: Use case and white space characters appropriate for display in the user interface. Metric names are rendered as-is. Capitalize the metric name. Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. If you want to specify more details about a custom metric, three other API methods are available: NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(String name, String category, double value) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits) NewRelicAgent.RecordMetricWithName(string name, string category, double value, string valueUnits, string countUnits) Copy With these methods, you can record additional details: Parameter Description count The number of times the event has happened totalValue The total value of the recording exclusiveValue The exclusive value of the recording; for example, if the total value contains measurements accounted for elsewhere countUnit Unit of measurement for the metric count, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS valueUnit Unit of measurement for the metric value, including PERCENT, BYTES, SECONDS, BYTES_PER_SECOND, or OPERATIONS To view the custom metrics you collect, follow standard procedures to create custom dashboards. Send custom events and attributes to Insights Caution The SDK can store up to 64 user-defined attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 64 attributes, the SDK returns false. Use the following static methods in the NewRelicAgent namespace to send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Methods that return boolean results return true if they succeed, or false if the operation did not complete. The following methods are available for custom attributes and events: RecordEvent (name, attributes) NewRelicAgent.RecordEvent (string name, string dictionary attributes) Copy Records a custom Insights event. Includes a list of attributes specified as a map. SetAttribute (name, value) NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, string value) Copy NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute (string name, double value) Copy Creates an attribute with the specified text name and text/float value. SetAttribute overwrites its previous value and type each time it is called. Examples boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"username\", \"SampleUserName\"); Copy boolean attributeSet = NewRelicAgent.SetAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99); Copy IncrementAttribute (name [, value]) public static boolean IncrementAttribute(String name); Copy public static boolean incrementAttribute(String name, double value) Copy If value is not specified, this method increments the count for the specified attribute by 1. If the attribute does not exist, it creates the attribute with a value of 1. If value is specified, the method will increment the attribute by the specified amount. Examples boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\"); Copy boolean incremented = NewRelicAgent.IncrementAttribute(\"rate\", 9999.99, false); Copy RemoveAttribute (name) NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(String name) Copy Removes the specified attribute. Example boolean attributeRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAttribute(\"rate\"); Copy removeAllAttributes NewRelicAgent.removeAllAttributes() Copy Removes all attributes from the session. Example boolean attributesRemoved = NewRelicAgent.RemoveAllAttributes(); Copy Track custom network requests New Relic Mobile's API provides several methods to track network requests and network failures. For example, use the noticeHttpTransaction family of methods to record HTTP transactions with several available levels of detail. If a network request fails, you can record details about the failure with noticeNetworkFailure. NoticeNetworkRequest NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkRequest (\"http://newrelic.com\", \"GET\", timer, null, 200, 1024, 8192, bytes, httpParameters); Copy Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST statusCode The statusCode of the HTTP response, such as 200 for OK timer A timer created when the network request was started bytesSent The number of bytes sent in the request bytesReceived The number of bytes received in the response responseBody The response body of the HTTP response. The response body will be truncated and included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. params Additional parameters included in an HTTP Error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error. NoticeNetworkFailure NewRelicAgent.NoticeNetworkFailure(String url, String httpMethod, Timer timer, NewRelicAgent.NetworkFailureCode failureCode, String message) Copy Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The HTTP method used, such as GET or POST timer A timer created when the network request was started exception The exception that occurred. New Relic Mobile can automatically translate many common exceptions into network failure types. failure The type of network failure that occurred. If an exception cannot be resolved to a network failure automatically, this method can be used to categorize the failure accurately. The values are defined by the NetworkFailure enum. Valid values include Unknown, BadURL, TimedOut, CannotConnectToHost, DNSLookupFailed, BadServerResponse, and SecureConnectionFailed. Uninstall plugin To uninstall the Unity plugin, use the project console to remove all related files and resources that were installed with the Unity package: Delete NewRelicAgent object from the Hierarchy pane of the Unity project console. From All Scripts, delete all the scripts that start with newrelic. Then do the following as applicable: From Assets > Plugin > iOS, delete the NewRelicIos, NewRelicUnityPlugin, post-build, and restore-framework files. Then remove the mod_pbxproj and NewRelicAgent.framework directories. From Assets > Plugin > Android, delete the newrelic.android and NewRelicAndroid files. Then remove the LICENSE and README directories. Unity release notes Caution These release notes are for historical reference. Unity is no longer supported for new customers.

      "body": "In case you haven’t heard, NerdGraph is New Relic’s unified API in a GraphQL flavor. The new dashboards API follows this unified approach and is exposed through NerdGraph for user consumption. Why a new dashboards API? Dashboards in New Relic embrace the entity concept and are now an entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Dashboards can now connect with any other type of entity for better observability solutions, which opens the door to endless opportunities we would like you to benefit from. At the same time, we have built new features for dashboards: All New Relic One dashboards are structured in pages, known as Data Apps in Insights Multiple queries from different accounts within the same widget Facet linking Facet linking with support for cases From REST endpoints to GraphQL queries/mutations One of the main benefits from a GraphQL API is that it provides a complete and understandable description of the APIs' data. By using NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. You can list all the dashboard entities you have access to: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy You can list all the dashboards by name: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy You can list all the dashboards by the creator’s email: { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy You can list all the dashboards by the creator’s userId: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type = 'DASHBOARD' and ownerId = \"2357322\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity GUID. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. In the example below we are only interested in the entity GUID and the name of our dashboard. { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid name } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example below is not complete but can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard GUID and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. The example is not complete but it can give you an understanding of how the mutation looks like. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. mutation { dashboardUpdate( guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\", dashboard: { name: \"My dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"Errors page\", widgets: {} } { name: \"Logs page\", widgets: {} } ], permissions: PUBLIC_READ_ONLY }) { entityResult { name guid updatedAt createdAt } errors { description type } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity GUID. mutation { dashboardDelete { status errors { type description } } } Copy Errors as first class citizens As you might have noticed, all dashboard mutations offer you a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem. mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } Copy",

Using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can also query NRQL data. These examples for querying cloud integration configuration data use GraphQL queries and mutations: Queries: requests that are intended to only fetch data Mutations: requests that create or update data on the server Requirements Before querying cloud integration data with NerdGraph, ensure you have: Followed the instructions to connect cloud integrations with New Relic. Created an API key. Access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer To access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: Go to https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Add any of the following examples. Query examples Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). Queries in NerdGraph are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Available provider accounts This query returns a list of all provider accounts available in your infrastructure data. Depending on the provider, additional properties can be requested. For example, for GCP, you can also ask for the serviceAccountId property, which is needed when linking a new GCP project to New Relic. Anonymous: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug ... on CloudGcpProvider { serviceAccountId } } } } } } Copy Named: query cloudProviders { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } } } } } Copy Specific provider account information This query returns information about a specific provider account for your Amazon AWS integration. The properties id, name, slug are requested, along with a list of integrations available to be monitored. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { id slug name services { id slug name } } } } } } Copy Specific integration data from a specific cloud provider This query returns information about a specific cloud service integration of a provider. In this example, the integration is the Amazon AWS ALB monitoring integration and the provider is AWS. The properties id, name, slug, and isAllowed are requested with the available configuration parameters. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { service(slug: \"alb\") { id name slug isEnabled } } } } } } Copy List of enabled cloud accounts This query returns the list of cloud accounts enabled with your New Relic account. (Your cloud account associates your New Relic account and a specific provider account with your integration.) You can enable multiple cloud provider accounts in the same New Relic account, even with the same cloud provider. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { id name createdAt provider { id name } } } } } } Copy Specific linked account data This query returns information about a linked account, including the properties name, providerId, and a list of the cloud integrations enabled for monitoring. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integrations { id name createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Enabled cloud integrations for all linked accounts This query returns all monitored integrations for all the provider cloud accounts. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { name provider { id name } integrations { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Specific cloud integration data for a specific linked account This query returns information about a specific integration from a specific linked account. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integration(id: <INTEGRATION_ID>) { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Mutation examples Mutations are requests that are intended to have side effects, such as creating or updating data on the server. Mutations require the keyword mutation and the name of the mutation. NerdGraph mutations are restricted to a subset of all possible mutations. Link an account This mutation allows linking cloud provider accounts to a New Relic account, creating one or more linked accounts. It can link one specific cloud provider account (for example aws) to the New Relic account or multiple cloud provider accounts to one New Relic account. Required: The parameter <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME> is required and cannot be empty. It must be unique in your New Relic account. Other parameters are specific to the provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) and are also required. In the following sections, you can see which parameters are required for each provider account. After linking an account the createdAt and updatedAt values are equal. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accounts: { accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link an Amazon AWS account This mutation links an Amazon AWS provider account to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link a Microsoft Azure account This mutation links a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, applicationId: <azure_application_id>, clientSecret: <azure_application_key>, tenantId: <azure_tenant_id>, subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Copy Link a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project This mutation links a GCP project to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, projectId: <GCP_PROJECT_ID> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Copy Rename one or more cloud accounts This mutation allows you to rename one or more linked provider accounts. The name parameter is required, cannot be empty, and must be unique within your New Relic account. mutation { cloudRenameAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: [ { id: <linked_cloud_account_id_1>, name: <new_provider_account_name> }, { id: <linked_cloud_account_id_2>, name: <new_provider_account_name> } ] ) { linkedAccounts { id name } } } Copy Enable an integration in a cloud account This mutation allows you to enable the monitoring of one or more specific cloud integrations in an existing cloud account. With this mutation, New Relic records data for the enabled integration from the provider account. For each provider account you have access to different input parameters, matching each available service. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, <other_parameters> }] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Enable an integration in multiple cloud accounts If you have many provider accounts linked, you can enable the same integration in the many cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug> : [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_2> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Enable multiple integrations in multiple cloud accounts If you have multiple cloud accounts linked, you can also enable multiple integrations in multiple linked cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug_1>: { <integration_slug_1>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_1> } ] <integration_slug_2>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_2> } ] }, <provider_slug_2>: { <integration_slug_3>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_3>}, { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_4>} ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Modify an integration's configuration (regions, polling intervals, etc.) This mutation also allows you to modify one or more cloud integrations and change one or more configuration parameters. Each service will have specific parameters that you can modify. For parameters of a type list (for example, awsRegion) supply the full list. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug>: { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: <new_polling_interval>, <parameter_1>: <value_1>, <parameter_N>: <value_N>, }] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval, <parameter_1>, <parameter_N> } } errors { type message } } } Copy Disable (remove) an integration This mutation allows you to disable an integration and stop data collection for the specific cloud integration. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { : { : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id name authLabel provider { id } } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Copy Unlink account This mutation allows you to unlink cloud provider accounts from New Relic account. Caution This action can not be undone. However, you can link the account again, but account history will still be lost. mutation { cloudUnlinkAccount ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } } ) { unlinkedAccounts { id name } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Copy Enable an Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To enable an Amazon AWS integration: Send query to fetch account data Send a query to fetch data about the account, specifically available providers and already created provider accounts: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } linkedAccounts { name integrations { id name } } } } } } Copy Link AWS provider account Link an AWS provider account, if there is not one already linked or if you want to link another AWS account: Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter. Provide a name for the provider account in the <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>. Include the ARN of the AWS role used to fetch data from your AWS account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } errors { type message } } } Copy Enable Amazon AWS SQS integration Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider account in the <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Copy Enable integration in multiple provider accounts If you have multiple accounts with the same provider account, you can enable the same integration in multiple provider accounts at the same time. Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider accounts in the <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_n> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_2>, configuration_param_1: value_1, configuration_param_2: value_2 } ] } } }) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Copy Change polling interval for Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To change the polling interval of an AWS integration: Update the polling interval To update the polling interval for an Amazon AWS SQS integration, use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the id of the linked provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value: mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws : { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: 300 } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval } } errors { type message } } } Copy Disable Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To disable an AWS integration: Disable the SQS integration Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the linked cloud account the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id accountId name } errors { type message } } } Copy",

      "body": "This doc contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically manage some New Relic API keys. For general information about New Relic keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description You can use the API keys UI to create and manage keys. Alternatively, you can use NerdGraph's ApiAccess field to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: User keys License keys, including: General license key (used for APM, infrastructure monitoring, more) Browser key (for browser monitoring) One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. Notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Regarding license keys: License keys are categorized by NerdGraph as ingest keys. This is because their main use is to allow data ingest. You can create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't manage or delete original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage keys you've created. Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query user keys in similar ways, replacing the ingest-key-specific fields with user-key-specific fields. To understand the data structure, we recommend experimenting with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete user keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a user key: Create a user key To create a user key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Copy Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.",

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. Tip The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } Copy NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Copy Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } Copy Tip The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } Copy In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } Copy In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Copy Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Copy Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } Copy Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Copy Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in the stream of data coming into New Relic. The stream of data that comes into New Relic is called a signal. You can control what part of the signal is alerted on through NRQL conditions. These NRQL condition alerts are processed by the streaming algorithm. The NRQL query provides the signal filter for all of your incoming data. Tip You can read more about the streaming alerts platform in this Explorers Hub post. Why it matters Alerts violations are easy when they're caused by a specific event happening, but trickier when looking for events not happening. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional offset delay allows for slower data to come through before it's processed. Once the aggregation window plus the offset time have elapsed, New Relic groups the aggregated data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation isn't triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools you can use to more effectively alert on your streaming data, giving you greater control and reducing the number of false alerts notifications. They are: Loss of signal detection Gap filling Aggregation window duration customization Offset evaluation Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Aggregation window In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before using the aggregation function to evaluate the data. A longer aggregation window gives straggling data points more time to arrive before evaluating that data. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 1 second and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Offset evaluation For data that consistently takes longer to arrive, you can use offset evaluation to consistently delay the NRQL condition evaluation. Waiting longer increases accuracy, but also increases latency. The offset time value is the number of aggregation windows you want to use. The duration for each window is set in the Aggregation window field. For example, if your aggregation window is 1 minute and your Offset evaluation is 3, then a straggling data point will have about 3 minutes to arrive before it might be dropped. In other words, streaming alerts will always keep 3 aggregation windows in the queue, waiting 1 minute before evaluating each window and adding a new one. The current default is 3.",

      "body": "You can use baseline conditions to define violation thresholds that adjust to the behavior of your data. Baseline alerting is useful for creating conditions that: Only notify you when data is behaving abnormally. Dynamically adjust to changing data and trend s, including daily or weekly trends. In addition, baseline alerting works well with new applications when you do not yet have known behaviors. How it works When you choose a data source (for example, an APM metric) for a baseline condition, we'll use the past values of that data to dynamically predict the data's near-future behavior. The line of that predicted future behavior for that value is called a baseline. It appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the baseline condition UI. You'll use the baseline alert condition UI to: Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source. Set the behavior that will trigger a violation (for example: \"deviating for more than five minutes\"). Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both. When your data escapes the predicted \"normal\" behavior and meets the criteria you've chosen, you'll receive a notification. Set baseline thresholds one.newrelic.com > AI & Alerts > Policies > (create or select policy) > Create alert condition: Baseline alert conditions give you the ability to set intelligent, self-adjusting thresholds that only generate violations when abnormal behavior is detected. To create a baseline condition: When you start to create a condition, choose one of the following data sources: APM: Application metric baseline Browser: Metric baseline NRQL (and then choose a baseline type threshold) Here are some tips for setting baseline thresholds: Set the baseline direction to monitor violations that happen either above or below the baseline. Set the preview chart to either 2 days or 7 days of displayed data. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Use the slider bar to adjust the Critical threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the baseline. The tighter the band around the baseline, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate. Optional: You can create a Warning threshold (the darker gray area around the baseline). For NRQL alerts, see the allowed types of NRQL queries. If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Baseline rules and settings Here are some details about how the UI works: Rules governing creation of baseline The algorithm for baseline conditions is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities: Data trait Baseline rules Age of data On initial creation, the baseline is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and baseline type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the baseline will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the baseline and thresholds will become. Consistency of data For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the baseline. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds. Regular fluctuations For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the baseline algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them. Baseline direction: select upper or lower ranges You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the baseline (\"upper\") or that goes below the baseline (\"lower\"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the Baseline direction selector. Example use cases for this: You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down. You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem. Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different baseline direction settings. The red areas represent violations. Preview chart: select 2 or 7 days When setting thresholds, the preview chart has an option for displaying Since 2 days ago or Since 7 days ago. These selections are not the time period used to compute the baseline; they are only the time range used for a preview display. For more about the time range used to calculate the baseline, see the algorithm rules.",

Important To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see Introduction to important concepts. Exceptions The health status indicator doesn't apply for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure entities Dashboards Entities targeted by labels Color-coded health status The index automatically appears when you select the product from the New Relic menu bar. For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Entity explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Entity explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations.

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. For example, let's say you query your applications, but you don't know which have been migrated to cloud and which haven't. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'On-premises', filter(count(*), WHERE duration < .06) as 'AWS' FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET cases, you can add the condition and obtain the status of the migration: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' facet cases(WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' OR appName = 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts On-Prem', WHERE appName != 'WebPortal' AND appName != 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts in Cloud') since 10 minutes ago limit 100 Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our entity explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the entity explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostModules directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "info": "Learn how to use New Relic to diagnose error alerts in your services.",
      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. For example, let's say you query your applications, but you don't know which have been migrated to cloud and which haven't. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'On-premises', filter(count(*), WHERE duration < .06) as 'AWS' FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET cases, you can add the condition and obtain the status of the migration: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName NOT LIKE '%Tower%' facet cases(WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' OR appName = 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts On-Prem', WHERE appName != 'WebPortal' AND appName != 'Plan Service' as '% of Hosts in Cloud') since 10 minutes ago limit 100 Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see our documentation on default data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. See your dashboards across all New Relic New Relic One dashboards have full backwards compatibility with the original New Relic platform, so any dashboard you have created in Insights will be automatically available in dashboards from day one. Reciprocally, when you add a new dashboard, it is also created in Insights. No further action is needed. With New Relic One you can also view dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Tip Switching to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our entity explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the entity explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advance configurations Extend webpack configuration You can use our .extended-webpackrc.js file to extend the webpack 4 configuration. This allows you to add your own aliases, scripts, and configurations when locally serving or deploying your app. Proxy browser setup Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic One. But understanding how this works can help you if you encounter issues (for example, with a proxy or browser setup). When developing, your code is served from your local laptop by using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and will use a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. In order to load third-party code into the platform, (both in development and production), New Relic One uses an <IFRAME>, as well as a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net) to perform the load, relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. For this reason, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where UserId is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform (you can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it). Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where NerdpackUuid is the UUID assigned to your package, and NerdpackGid is zero, or a positive integer (you can use 0|[1-9]\\d+ to discriminate it).

      "body": "Building your own visualizations for New Relic dashboards enables you and your organization to query data from any source and display it on your dashboard. In this guide, you'll learn how to use the CLI to generate a visualization file structure, run it locally where you can quickly test and iterate, and then deploy it for use in a dashboard. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have a New Relic account. To complete this guide, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. Create a new visualization In this first set of steps you will use the CLI to quickly generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 3 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Start with a new Nerdpack. If you just installed the New Relic One CLI, then you have a new Nerdpack project directory (called something like my-awesome-nerdpack). If you need to create one, run nr1 create and select the nerdpack option. bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name my-awesome-nerdpack Step 3 of 3 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack project and run the nr1 create command, selecting the visualization option. bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization As a result, you have a new visualization directory matching the name you gave your visualization. It is located in the visualizations directory in the root of your Nerdpack project. The files created provide an example visualization – a radar chart populated by a basic NRQL query. The nr1.json file provides metadata. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. These are the fields users will fill in to create an instance of the visualization. Supported input types are: boolean string number json nrql: a single NRQL query string. namespace: a group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. collection: a repeatable group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. The nrqlQueries entry is an example of a collection type. The index.js file is where you define the React component that receives the props and renders the visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. If your visualization queries data over a time range and you want it to utilize the platform time range setting, you will need to utilize the timeRange value from PlatformStateContext. The timeRange can be passed directly to the NrqlQuery component. Setting the NrqlQuery component's pollInterval prop to NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL automatically handles calculating an appriate data polling interval. <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {({timeRange}) => ( <NrqlQuery timeRange={timeRange} pollInterval={NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL} > ... Copy Render the visualization in local development Now run the generated visualization locally, and view it in Custom Visualizations. There you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 7 Start the local Node server for your Nerdpack. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Important To see changes to the nr1.json file take effect, restart the local Node server. Changes to the definition of the configuration field will not show up in the prop configuration side bar of the Custom Visualizations UI until you stop the local Node server and start it back up. Step 2 of 7 In a browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. This url is also shown in the terminal when the Node server starts. The nerdpacks=local query string will direct the UI to load your new visualization artifact from the local Node server. Advanced nerdpack configuration See the advanced nerdpack configuration section for detailed information about how your local Node server is proxied to the browser and how you can override webpack configuration if needed. Step 3 of 7 Open the Apps page, and navigate to Custom Visualizations, which you will find favorited by default. Step 4 of 7 In the Custom Visualizations listing, find and click on the tile for your visualization. If the tile is not showing up or it is not indicating that it is running locally, restart the Node server and refresh the browser. When you select your locally running visualization, the visualization hosted by your local Node server is rendered with prop-configuration inputs. Here you can take advantage of the features outlined in the following steps. Step 5 of 7 You can set prop values and see the visualization update automatically. The prop inputs are listed as defined in the prop definitions located in the nr1.json file in the visualization folder (for example ./visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json). Fill in values for the props and see the visualization update automatically. As you change props in the sidebar, a render cycle of your visualization's React component is triggered. Step 6 of 7 Modify the visualization's Javascript code and see the result automatically update in the UI. For example, you can change the value for fillOpacity on the Radar component in index.js. Upon save, you will see the page automatically update. fillOpacity={1.0} visualizations/your-visualization/index.js Copy Step 7 of 7 To add more props, you must update the configuration field in the nr1.json file for your visualization and restart the local Node server. The props you define in the configuration field allow New Relic One to cleanly display a prop-editing UI for users interacting with your visualization. See above for more information about the configuration field. Deploy and use your visualization When your visualization is ready to be added to a dashboard, just follow these steps. Step 1 of 2 Open and follow the guide to publish and deploy the Nerdpack to New Relic One and subscribe accounts to it. Step 2 of 2 Then you can add your visualization to a dashboard. Summary Congratulations on completing the steps in this example!

      "body": "When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Undeploy your app You can also manually undeploy an app. Undeploying an app is detaching a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. Before undeploying, you need to unsubscribe your account from the deployed Nerdpack, then specify the UUID of the Nerdpack you've unsubscribed as the one to undeploy. Step 1 of 3 To get a list of deployed Nerdpacks that your account is subscribed to, run nr1 subscription:list. Step 2 of 3 Copy the UUID of the Nerdpack that you want to unsubscribe and pass it to the nerdpack-id option of the unsubscribe command: nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=<UUID> Copy You should get a result like this: Unsubscribed account <your account ID> from the nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID>. Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe the Nerdpack UUID used in step 2: nr1 nerdpack:undeploy --nerdpack-id=<UUID> -t STABLE Copy You should get the result Undeployed nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID> from the STABLE channel. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "info": "How to use charts in your NR1 app.",
      "body": "In your application, you can display data in charts, like those used elsewhere in New Relic's user interface. The New Relic One SDK provides React components for different chart types. Once you decide the kind of data you want to present, either from New Relic or some other source, you supply that data to your chart, using props. Query New Relic data In some cases, you want to fetch data from New Relic's database. For example, you may want to display a line chart which plots the number of transactions your application receives over time. With your chart component, set the accountId and query props to query your New Relic data using NRQL: <LineChart accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" />; Copy Alternatively, you can fetch data with a NrqlQuery and set the data prop: <NrqlQuery accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\"> {({ data }) => <LineChart data={data} />} </NrqlQuery>; Copy If you're looking to visualize New Relic data, such as your web application's response times or your server's throughput, querying data in your charts is the way to go. But what if you want to create charts that aren't focused on New Relic data? The data prop is flexible enough that you can supply any arbitrary data, as long as it matches the standardized format. Craft custom data Whether you use custom data sets or the results of a NrqlQuery, a chart's data prop must be an array of objects where each object has both of the following fields: metadata: Defines how the chart presents its data data: An array of data points that appear on the chart For example, create a chart consisting of a line between two points by supplying two x-y coordinates in its data field: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy This LineChart plots a line between coordinates (0, 0) and (20, 10). Use x-y coordinates for all two-dimensional chart formats. For other formats, which you'll learn more about later, use other types of data points. Because data accepts an array, you can supply two series to the same chart: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'series-2', name: 'My second series', viz: 'main', color: 'red', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 50, }, { x: 20, y: 100, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy In this example, you create a single chart with two series. The first series contains the line from the last example. The second series contains a line between points (0, 50) and (20, 100). When using two series in a single chart, like this, you may want to define how the chart represents each series. Use metadata to define those elements. Metadata A series's metadata defines certain features of the series, itself, such as how it should be displayed in your chart. metadata consists of the following attributes: Attribute Description id The series's identifier. Two series having the same id are considered the same series, regardless of where they are located. In general, use a unique id for each series. However, if you use the same series for multiple charts, keeping the id consistent can help with some cross-chart functionality, like simultaneously highlighting multiple charts. name The series's name. name is used in legends, tooltips, and other areas to indicate which series you’re looking at. color The series's color. Most visualizations use this value to differentiate series. Some visualizations, like BillboardChart or JsonChart, ignore it. Use any valid CSS color representation, such as #RRGGBB, hsl(HHH, SS%, LL%), or rgba(RR, GG, BB, .AA). Avoid tweaking the alpha value, when possible, because charts use alpha to highlight or dim certain series. viz The series's visual style. While you most often use main, this field accepts several options: main: Show the series based on chart's type. For instance, a LineChart shows the series as a line, and an AreaChart shows the series as an area. line: Show the series as a line, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to AreaChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. area: Show the series as an area, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to LineChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. event: Show the series as an event, regardless of the chart's type. Charts represent an event as a vertical area behind the main visualization. Events are often used to show alerts. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. target-line: Show the series as a vertical line. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. units_data You can assign a unit type to each axis on a chart. The chart will present data according to the unit type you set with units_data. To set unit_data, pass a JSON object with maps the axis to one of the following unit types: UNKNOWN: The chart displays the series with no special units. COUNT: Each value in the chart represents a count. The chart formats values with their International System prefix. For example, \"k\" represents thousands, \"M\" represents millions, and \"G\" represents billions. PERCENTAGE: Each value in the chart represents a percentage. Typically, you provide values ranging from 0 to 1. The chart formats a value of 1 as \"100%\", a value of 2 as \"200%\", and a value of 0.01 as \"1%\". MS: Each value in the chart represents some number of milliseconds. The chart represents values higher than 1 as a human-readable time duration. For example, 60000 is represented as \"1 minute\". The chart represents values lower than 1 using SI prefixes. For example, 0.001 is represented as 1 μs. TIMESTAMP: Each value in the chart represents a timestamp, the number milliseconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the UNIX Epoch. The chart formats each value as a date. BITS: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits. The chart formats these values using \"b\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb\". BITS_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits per second. The chart formats these values using \"b/s\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb/s\". BYTES: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes. The chart formats these values using \"B\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB\". BYTES_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes per second. The chart formats these values using \"B/s\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB/s\". So, to represent the y-axis for your series in bits, set the y-value in units_data: { \"units_data\": { \"y\": \"BITS\" } } Data While a data series can contain any arbitrary values, a chart only uses values which adhere to its type. So, create your data points according to the chart type: Series Type Example Description Unidimensional [{ \"y\": 10 }, { \"y\": 20 }] The chart plots data points using y values. Use this format with BarChart, BillboardChart, PieChart, StackedBarChart. Two-dimensional [ { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 30 } ] The chart plots data points using x and y values. Use this format with AreaChart, LineChart, ScatterChart, SparklineChart, Funnel [{ \"label1\": 10, \"label2\": 20 }] The chart plots data according to labels. Use this format with FunnelChart. Table [{ \"jobType\": \"SIMPLE\", \"count\": 18 }] The chart plots data according to table columns. You must specify table columns in the metadata. Use this format with TableChart. Event [ { \"x0\": 0, \"x1\": 5 }, { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 15 } ] The chart plots the event's width based on x0 and x1 values. Histogram [ { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 20, \"y\": 100 }, { \"x0\": 30, \"x1\": 40, \"y\": 150 } ] The chart plots the series's width based on x0 and x1 and height based on y. Use this format with HistogramChart and HeatmapChart. Tip JsonChart is a special case because it processes any valid data. For example, you can set an arbitrary JSON object for the chart's data: const data = { data: [ { id: 1, name: 'Foo', price: 123, tags: ['Bar', 'Eek'], stock: { warehouse: 300, retail: 20, } } ], } <JsonChart data={data} /> Copy Special States In previous sections, you learned that a chart's data is an array of series. But you can use special values to present special chart states: null or undefined: Indicates the chart is “loading” its data. In this state, the chart shows a placeholder data set. []: Indicates there is no data to show. The chart states, \"No chart data available\". Configure your chart As you've seen, you use query or data to supply data to your chart, but you can configure other aspects of your chart, too, such as visual settings and click and hover event listeners. Read the documentation for the chart you're using for more specific information. Chart Groups Under some circumstances, you might want to synchronize events, such as dragging or scrubbing, across multiple charts. To do this, use a ChartGroup. All charts in a ChartGroup synchronize their events: <ChartGroup> <Stack> <StackItem> <LineChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\" /> </StackItem> <StackItem> <AreaChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Synthetics SINCE 1 day ago\" /> </StackItem> </Stack> </ChartGroup>; Copy Ideally, group charts that are conceptually related, and separate charts that are conceptually unrelated. Next Step Read the documentation specific to the chart you'd like to use to learn specifics about that chart's behavior and configuration.",

      "body": "New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app ✔ Component created successfully! nerdpack pageviews-app is available at \"./pageviews-app\" Serve the project up to New Relic: bash Copy $ cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ✔ PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) nr1.json Launchers: ✔ pageviews-app-launcher launchers/pageviews-app-launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ✔ pageviews-app-nerdlet nerdlets/pageviews-app-nerdlet/nr1.json 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! ★ Starting as orchestrator... ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://staging-one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 3 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 4 5 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 6 render() { 7 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 8 } 9 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 9 } 10 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line with this export code: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <div className=\"row\"> 12 <TextField 13 placeholder=\"US\" 14 onChange={(event) => { 15 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 16 }} 17 /> 18 </div> 19 <TableChart 20 accountId={accountId} 21 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 22 fullWidth 23 className=\"chart\" 24 /> 25 </div> 26 </div> 27 ); 28 } 29 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 return ( 16 <div className=\"container\"> 17 <div className=\"row\"> 18 <div className=\"row\"> 19 <TextField 20 placeholder=\"US\" 21 onChange={(event) => { 22 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 23 }} 24 /> 25 </div> 26 <TableChart 27 accountId={accountId} 28 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 29 fullWidth 30 className=\"chart\" 31 /> 32 </div> 33 </div> 34 ); 35 } 36 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Above return, add: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 31 fullWidth 32 className=\"chart\" 33 /> 34 </div> 35 </div> 36 ); 37 } 38 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ 31 countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' 32 } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 33 fullWidth 34 className=\"chart\" 35 /> 36 </div> 37 </div> 38 ); 39 } 40 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Reload your app to try out the text field.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

Identify areas of improvement, and plan your changes. Want to learn more? See the video (it's only 45 seconds!): Short guide to using the New Relic Explorer. View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. Toggle between the Explorer's three views and the following features: List. Browse and filter from a list of all the entities in your account. Use this landing interface to navigate, group and filter your entities. New Relic Navigator. Get a high density overview of all your entities, grouped by entity type or by tags. Use this to detect any issues and health patterns at a glance. New Relic Lookout. Spot entities that have recent performance deviations. Use this to quickly identify unusual behaviors. Other components include: Filterbar. Drill down and locate problematic entities easily with our improved search capabilities, and benefit from the AND and OR operators in place. See everything. All the different entity types you have access to are listed in the collapsible sidebar on the left of the screen. This sidebar is interactive and used for exploratory purposes, and it allows you to see only entities of the selected type, updating the filter from the filterbar. Create a new workload for meaningful groupings of your monitored entities. Add more data to instrument more elements of your system and achieve full stack observability. List view Your monitored entities are on the left, in a collapsable menu. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. The list view also has a collapsable activity stream on the right side. You can see different useful events related to the first 25 alerting entities which are currently being filtered. Click on any entity for more details on its performance. The entity overview also incorporates the relationship between the selected entity and other entities in your system. New Relic Navigator The New Relic Navigator makes it easy to explore large numbers of entities as it intuitively displays the entire estate of your system in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts. With the New Relic Navigator you can: Quickly explore the health of your environment at a glance. See all the entities that belong to all your accounts, and focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Group and filter across all your entities to quickly zero in on issues. Click on any entity to see a mini-overview of its activity, metrics, and meta-data. New Relic Lookout New Relic Lookout provides an intuitive view of entities that are deviating from normal behavior, using circle visualization with color indicating severity and size conveying the scale of recent changes. You don’t need to configure anything: New Relic Lookout automatically compares performance within the last five minutes against the previous hour. Use New Relic Lookout to: Select the entity type to see golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors across all your accounts. Zoom in with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s profiles across your estate. Click on an entity of interest to access the mini-overview component. Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries and charts. Now we have New Relic One, which has its own query builder experience. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience compared to Insights. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features Why it's easy to switch to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Improved features in New Relic One New Relic One is an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights. Features include: Better querying and charting experiences, including a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL Better display options that are easier to understand, especially with dense, line-heavy charts and a better TV mode More charts or widgets across dashboards (up to 12 now, instead of Insights' 3-across limit Easier creation of dashboards with multiple pages (previously called data apps in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Improved experience for querying metric data, both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data Easy customization for your visualizations Try out New Relic One It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the recommendations before you do. Then, to view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click Try new dashboards. Recommendations The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation: Important If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards. If you create some types of dashboards in New Relic One, their improved features may lose functionality when edited in Insights. These include: Dashboards created using the Insights metric explorer. When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights. Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One. New customization features result in incompatibilities between New Relic One and Insights charts. Also: Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called Data apps. When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the Data apps section. Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following Manage data UI pages will remain in Insights for now: Summary UI page Add data UI page Embeddables UI page Lookup tables UI page API keys UI page Formatter UI page To find these pages: go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data Learn more For a more detailed look of New Relic One dashboard features, see this Explorers Hub post.

Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app ✔ Component created successfully! nerdpack pageviews-app is available at \"./pageviews-app\" Serve the project up to New Relic: bash Copy $ cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ✔ PageviewsApp (00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45) nr1.json Launchers: ✔ pageviews-app-launcher launchers/pageviews-app-launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ✔ pageviews-app-nerdlet nerdlets/pageviews-app-nerdlet/nr1.json 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! ★ Starting as orchestrator... ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://staging-one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 00e0f043-1fc3-42cd-a8ca-7eef5fc9cd45--pageviews-app-nerdlet built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 3 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 4 5 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 6 render() { 7 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 8 } 9 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; 9 } 10 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line with this export code: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"></div> 11 </div> 12 ); 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <TableChart 12 accountId={accountId} 13 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 14 fullWidth 15 className=\"chart\" 16 /> 17 </div> 18 </div> 19 ); 20 } 21 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 render() { 8 return ( 9 <div className=\"container\"> 10 <div className=\"row\"> 11 <div className=\"row\"> 12 <TextField 13 placeholder=\"US\" 14 onChange={(event) => { 15 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 16 }} 17 /> 18 </div> 19 <TableChart 20 accountId={accountId} 21 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 22 fullWidth 23 className=\"chart\" 24 /> 25 </div> 26 </div> 27 ); 28 } 29 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 return ( 16 <div className=\"container\"> 17 <div className=\"row\"> 18 <div className=\"row\"> 19 <TextField 20 placeholder=\"US\" 21 onChange={(event) => { 22 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 23 }} 24 /> 25 </div> 26 <TableChart 27 accountId={accountId} 28 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 29 fullWidth 30 className=\"chart\" 31 /> 32 </div> 33 </div> 34 ); 35 } 36 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Above return, add: index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 31 fullWidth 32 className=\"chart\" 33 /> 34 </div> 35 </div> 36 ); 37 } 38 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. index.js styles.scss .extended-webpackrc.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import { TableChart, TextField } from 'nr1'; 3 4 const accountId = 0; // Replace with your account ID 5 6 export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { 7 constructor(props) { 8 super(props); 9 this.state = { 10 countryCode: null, 11 }; 12 } 13 14 render() { 15 const { countryCode } = this.state; 16 17 return ( 18 <div className=\"container\"> 19 <div className=\"row\"> 20 <div className=\"row\"> 21 <TextField 22 placeholder=\"US\" 23 onChange={(event) => { 24 this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); 25 }} 26 /> 27 </div> 28 <TableChart 29 accountId={accountId} 30 query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ 31 countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' 32 } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} 33 fullWidth 34 className=\"chart\" 35 /> 36 </div> 37 </div> 38 ); 39 } 40 } pageview-app-nerdlet/index.js Copy 1 .container { 2 width: 100%; 3 height: 99vh; 4 display: flex; 5 flex-direction: column; 6 .row { 7 margin: 10px; 8 display: flex; 9 flex-direction: row; 10 } 11 .chart { 12 height: 250px; 13 } 14 } pageview-app-nerdlet/styles.scss Copy 1 .extended-webpackrc.js Copy Reload your app to try out the text field.

This document provides examples and reference information for our API endpoints. For developer-focused content on how to use and customize New Relic, see developer.newrelic.com. Tip To use APIs and SDKs, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. New Relic provides a powerful GraphQL tool to explore the API with embedded schema definitions. To get started, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Tip For sample queries and mutations, use our NerdGraph tutorials. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Tip To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries.

      "body": "For some types of data in New Relic, you can drop (not report) that data. You might want to do this: To filter out unimportant, low-value data To filter out potentially sensitive data If you choose to drop data, only new data will be affected. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted. Requirements You must have a user role with permissions for dropping data. Currently the following types of data can be targeted for data dropping: APM-reported events Browser-reported events Mobile-reported events Synthetics-reported events Custom events (like those generated by the APM agent APIs or the Event API) Log data Trace spans Dimensional metrics, with these caveats: Billing impacts: for New Relic One pricing, dropped data is not billable. For original pricing, dropped data is billable. For metrics generated by the events-to-metrics service: drop rules won't work but these metrics can be stopped or attributes pruned by disabling or re-configuring the events-to-metric rule. Support for additional types are planned for the future. Create drop data rule Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, please review caution information below. To drop data, create a NerdGraph-format drop rule that includes: A NRQL string that specifies what data types to drop An action type specifying how to apply the NRQL string You can form and make the call in the NerdGraph explorer. There are two ways to drop data: Drop entire data types or a data subset (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_DATA action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT * FROM DATA_TYPE_1, DATA_TYPE_2 (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) Copy For this type of drop rule, you cannot use anything other than * in the SELECT clause. Drop attributes from data types (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_ATTRIBUTES action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM DATA_TYPE (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) Copy For this type of drop rule, you must pass in a non-empty list of raw attributes names. NRQL restrictions Not all NRQL clauses make sense for generating drop rules. You can provide a WHERE clause to select data with specific attributes. Other features such as TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH, FACET, and other clauses cannot be used. The two action types have these restrictions: DROP_DATA can use only SELECT *. DROP_ATTRIBUTES requires use of SELECT with \"raw\" attributes (attributes with no aggregator function applied). This also means you cannot use SELECT *. Additionally, there are some attributes that are integral to their data type and cannot be dropped (such as timestamp on event data). If you include them, registration will fail. Example drop rules Here are some example drop rules: Drop two event types Let's say you notice you have some event types being sent to New Relic that are not important to you. Also, stopping the source from sending those event types quickly is unrealistic, requiring changes to agents and/or API instrumentation. Using a drop rule is an easier way to accomplish the same goal. Here is an example NerdGraph call that drops two event types: Event1 and Event2. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Event1, Event2\" description: \"Drops all data for Event1 and Event2.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Drop events meeting certain criteria Let’s say you have a high volume custom event type that arrives from multiple sources. If you don't find all of that data important, you can use a drop rule. Here is an example of a drop rule that filters out events based on specific criteria. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM MyCustomEvent WHERE appName='LoadGeneratingApp' AND environment='development'\" description: \"Drops all data for MyCustomEvent that comes from the LoadGeneratingApp in the dev environment, because there is too much and we don’t look at it.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Drop sensitive attributes while maintaining the rest of the data Let's say you noticed an event has attributes that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You are working to update your services to stop sending the data, but until then, you need to cease storing further PII in New Relic. Although you could drop all of the data as it comes in the door with a DROP_DATA rule, the rest of the data still provides value. Therefore, you can register a drop rule to remove only the offending PII from your data: mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_ATTRIBUTES nrql: \"SELECT userEmail, userName FROM MyCustomEvent description: \"Removes the user name and email fields from MyCustomEvent\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Verify your drop rule works After you create a drop rule, verify that it is working as expected. The rule should take effect quickly after a successful registration, so try running a TIMESERIES version of the query you registered to see that the data drops off. Drop rule type NRQL DROP_DATA Drop rule NRQL: SELECT * FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Copy Validation NRQL: SELECT count(*) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Copy This should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect any thing else, invert the WHERE clause. DROP_ATTRIBUTES Drop rule NRQL: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Copy Validation NRQL: SELECT count(dropAttr1), count(dropAttr2) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Copy Both lines should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect events that contained these attributes and still should, invert the WHERE clause. View rules Here is an example NerdGraph call that returns the drop rules set on an account: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrqlDropRules { list { rules { id nrql accountId action createdBy createdAt description } error { reason description } } } } } } Copy Delete drop rules Here is an example NerdGraph call deleting two specific drop rules: mutation { nrqlDropRulesDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ruleIds: [\"48\", \"98\"]) { successes { id nrql accountId action description } failures { error { reason description } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy Audit drop rule history To see who created and deleted drop rules, query your account audit logs. The list endpoint also includes the user ID of the person who created the rule. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic does not review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Rules you create, including all information in those rules, can be viewed and edited by any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions. Only new data will be dropped. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted.

New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ _ NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' _ address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: Remember to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML.

This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Undeploy your app You can also manually undeploy an app. Undeploying an app is detaching a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. Before undeploying, you need to unsubscribe your account from the deployed Nerdpack, then specify the UUID of the Nerdpack you've unsubscribed as the one to undeploy. Step 1 of 3 To get a list of deployed Nerdpacks that your account is subscribed to, run nr1 subscription:list. Step 2 of 3 Copy the UUID of the Nerdpack that you want to unsubscribe and pass it to the nerdpack-id option of the unsubscribe command: nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=<UUID> Copy You should get a result like this: Unsubscribed account <your account ID> from the nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID>. Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe the Nerdpack UUID used in step 2: nr1 nerdpack:undeploy --nerdpack-id=<UUID> -t STABLE Copy You should get the result Undeployed nerdpack <Nerdpack UUID> from the STABLE channel. Subscribe or unsubscribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations include an integration for reporting your Amazon VPC data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported. Features The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network that utilizes the scalable infrastructure of Amazon Web Services (AWS). With New Relic's VPC integration, you can gain visibility into configuration event changes that are overlaid across your Amazon services. The Amazon VPC integration generates a feed of configuration/inventory changes that occur in your VPC. VPC data is available in pre-built dashboards, and you can create custom queries and charts in New Relic One. You can also create alert conditions to notify you about changes in the VPC. Additionally, Enhanced Amazon VPC Flow Logs enables you to capture information about IP traffic to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Activate To enable this integration follow standard procedures to Connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Amazon VPC integration: Default New Relic polling interval: 15 minutes Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the VPC integration links. You can query and explore your data using the PrivateNetworkSample event type, with provider values of: VpcNatGateway VpcVpnTunnel By default, collection of VpcNatGateway, VpcVpnTunnel, and VpcVpnConnection data is disabled. This is because if you have many NAT gateways or many VPNs (connections and tunnels), it might lead to an increase on your CloudWatch bill. For this reason, the integration provides configuration settings to set whether you want to fetch that data. For more on how to use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data VPC NAT Gateway data This integration collects the following data from PrivateNetworkSample with a provider value of VpcNatGateway: Tip For full descriptions, see Amazon VPC NAT Gateway Metrics and Dimensions. Name Description activeConnectionCount The total number of concurrent active TCP connections through the NAT gateway. bytesInFromDestination The number of bytes received by the NAT gateway from the destination. bytesInFromSource The number of bytes received by the NAT gateway from clients in your VPC. bytesOutToDestination The number of bytes sent out through the NAT gateway to the destination. bytesOutToSource The number of bytes sent through the NAT gateway to the clients in your VPC. connectionAttemptCount The number of connection attempts made through the NAT gateway. connectionEstablishedCount The number of connections established through the NAT gateway. errorPortAllocation The number of times the NAT gateway could not allocate a source port. idleTimeoutCount The number of connections that transitioned from the active state to the idle state. An active connection transitions to idle if it was not closed gracefully and there was no activity for the last 350 seconds. packetsDropCount The number of packets dropped by the NAT gateway. packetsInFromDestination The number of packets received by the NAT gateway from the destination. packetsInFromSource The number of packets received by the NAT gateway from clients in your VPC. packetsOutToDestination The number of packets sent out through the NAT gateway to the destination. packetsOutToSource The number of packets sent through the NAT gateway to the clients in your VPC. VPC VPN Tunnel This integration collects the following data from PrivateNetworkSample with a provider value of VpcVpnTunnel: Tip For full descriptions, see Amazon VPC VPN Metrics and Dimensions. Name Description tunnelState The state of the tunnel. 0 indicates DOWN and 1 indicates UP. tunnelDataIn The bytes received through the VPN tunnel. Each metric data point represents the number of bytes received after the previous data point. Use the Sum statistic to show the total number of bytes received during the period. tunnelDataOut The bytes sent through the VPN tunnel. Each metric data point represents the number of bytes sent after the previous data point. Use the Sum statistic to show the total number of bytes sent during the period. Inventory data This integration reports the following VPC configuration options and metadata as inventory data. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "Building your own visualizations for New Relic dashboards enables you and your organization to query data from any source and display it on your dashboard. In this guide, you'll learn how to use the CLI to generate a visualization file structure, run it locally where you can quickly test and iterate, and then deploy it for use in a dashboard. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have a New Relic account. To complete this guide, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. Create a new visualization In this first set of steps you will use the CLI to quickly generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 3 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Start with a new Nerdpack. If you just installed the New Relic One CLI, then you have a new Nerdpack project directory (called something like my-awesome-nerdpack). If you need to create one, run nr1 create and select the nerdpack option. bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name my-awesome-nerdpack Step 3 of 3 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack project and run the nr1 create command, selecting the visualization option. bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization As a result, you have a new visualization directory matching the name you gave your visualization. It is located in the visualizations directory in the root of your Nerdpack project. The files created provide an example visualization – a radar chart populated by a basic NRQL query. The nr1.json file provides metadata. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. These are the fields users will fill in to create an instance of the visualization. Supported input types are: boolean string number json nrql: a single NRQL query string. namespace: a group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. collection: a repeatable group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. The nrqlQueries entry is an example of a collection type. The index.js file is where you define the React component that receives the props and renders the visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. If your visualization queries data over a time range and you want it to utilize the platform time range setting, you will need to utilize the timeRange value from PlatformStateContext. The timeRange can be passed directly to the NrqlQuery component. Setting the NrqlQuery component's pollInterval prop to NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL automatically handles calculating an appriate data polling interval. <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {({timeRange}) => ( <NrqlQuery timeRange={timeRange} pollInterval={NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL} > ... Copy Render the visualization in local development Now run the generated visualization locally, and view it in Custom Visualizations. There you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 7 Start the local Node server for your Nerdpack. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Important To see changes to the nr1.json file take effect, restart the local Node server. Changes to the definition of the configuration field will not show up in the prop configuration side bar of the Custom Visualizations UI until you stop the local Node server and start it back up. Step 2 of 7 In a browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. This url is also shown in the terminal when the Node server starts. The nerdpacks=local query string will direct the UI to load your new visualization artifact from the local Node server. Advanced nerdpack configuration See the advanced nerdpack configuration section for detailed information about how your local Node server is proxied to the browser and how you can override webpack configuration if needed. Step 3 of 7 Open the Apps page, and navigate to Custom Visualizations, which you will find favorited by default. Step 4 of 7 In the Custom Visualizations listing, find and click on the tile for your visualization. If the tile is not showing up or it is not indicating that it is running locally, restart the Node server and refresh the browser. When you select your locally running visualization, the visualization hosted by your local Node server is rendered with prop-configuration inputs. Here you can take advantage of the features outlined in the following steps. Step 5 of 7 You can set prop values and see the visualization update automatically. The prop inputs are listed as defined in the prop definitions located in the nr1.json file in the visualization folder (for example ./visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json). Fill in values for the props and see the visualization update automatically. As you change props in the sidebar, a render cycle of your visualization's React component is triggered. Step 6 of 7 Modify the visualization's Javascript code and see the result automatically update in the UI. For example, you can change the value for fillOpacity on the Radar component in index.js. Upon save, you will see the page automatically update. fillOpacity={1.0} visualizations/your-visualization/index.js Copy Step 7 of 7 To add more props, you must update the configuration field in the nr1.json file for your visualization and restart the local Node server. The props you define in the configuration field allow New Relic One to cleanly display a prop-editing UI for users interacting with your visualization. See above for more information about the configuration field. Deploy and use your visualization When your visualization is ready to be added to a dashboard, just follow these steps. Step 1 of 2 Open and follow the guide to publish and deploy the Nerdpack to New Relic One and subscribe accounts to it. Step 2 of 2 Then you can add your visualization to a dashboard. Summary Congratulations on completing the steps in this example! You've learned how to: Create a visualization and run it locally Quickly test and iterate on visualization code changes in Custom Visualizations Deploy a visualization Add a custom visualization to a dashboard",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Building your own visualizations for New Relic dashboards enables you and your organization to query data from any source and display it on your dashboard. In this guide, you'll learn how to use the CLI to generate a visualization file structure, run it locally where you can quickly test and iterate, and then deploy it for use in a dashboard. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have a New Relic account. To complete this guide, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. Create a new visualization In this first set of steps you will use the CLI to quickly generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 3 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 3 Start with a new Nerdpack. If you just installed the New Relic One CLI, then you have a new Nerdpack project directory (called something like my-awesome-nerdpack). If you need to create one, run nr1 create and select the nerdpack option. bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name my-awesome-nerdpack Step 3 of 3 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack project and run the nr1 create command, selecting the visualization option. bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization As a result, you have a new visualization directory matching the name you gave your visualization. It is located in the visualizations directory in the root of your Nerdpack project. The files created provide an example visualization – a radar chart populated by a basic NRQL query. The nr1.json file provides metadata. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. These are the fields users will fill in to create an instance of the visualization. Supported input types are: boolean string number json nrql: a single NRQL query string. namespace: a group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. collection: a repeatable group of input fields to be displayed together under a shared heading in the prop-editing UI. The nrqlQueries entry is an example of a collection type. The index.js file is where you define the React component that receives the props and renders the visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. If your visualization queries data over a time range and you want it to utilize the platform time range setting, you will need to utilize the timeRange value from PlatformStateContext. The timeRange can be passed directly to the NrqlQuery component. Setting the NrqlQuery component's pollInterval prop to NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL automatically handles calculating an appriate data polling interval. <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {({timeRange}) => ( <NrqlQuery timeRange={timeRange} pollInterval={NrqlQuery.AUTO_POLL_INTERVAL} > ... Copy Render the visualization in local development Now run the generated visualization locally, and view it in Custom Visualizations. There you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 7 Start the local Node server for your Nerdpack. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Important To see changes to the nr1.json file take effect, restart the local Node server. Changes to the definition of the configuration field will not show up in the prop configuration side bar of the Custom Visualizations UI until you stop the local Node server and start it back up. Step 2 of 7 In a browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. This url is also shown in the terminal when the Node server starts. The nerdpacks=local query string will direct the UI to load your new visualization artifact from the local Node server. Advanced nerdpack configuration See the advanced nerdpack configuration section for detailed information about how your local Node server is proxied to the browser and how you can override webpack configuration if needed. Step 3 of 7 Open the Apps page, and navigate to Custom Visualizations, which you will find favorited by default. Step 4 of 7 In the Custom Visualizations listing, find and click on the tile for your visualization. If the tile is not showing up or it is not indicating that it is running locally, restart the Node server and refresh the browser. When you select your locally running visualization, the visualization hosted by your local Node server is rendered with prop-configuration inputs. Here you can take advantage of the features outlined in the following steps. Step 5 of 7 You can set prop values and see the visualization update automatically. The prop inputs are listed as defined in the prop definitions located in the nr1.json file in the visualization folder (for example ./visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json). Fill in values for the props and see the visualization update automatically. As you change props in the sidebar, a render cycle of your visualization's React component is triggered. Step 6 of 7 Modify the visualization's Javascript code and see the result automatically update in the UI. For example, you can change the value for fillOpacity on the Radar component in index.js. Upon save, you will see the page automatically update. fillOpacity={1.0} visualizations/your-visualization/index.js Copy Step 7 of 7 To add more props, you must update the configuration field in the nr1.json file for your visualization and restart the local Node server. The props you define in the configuration field allow New Relic One to cleanly display a prop-editing UI for users interacting with your visualization. See above for more information about the configuration field. Deploy and use your visualization When your visualization is ready to be added to a dashboard, just follow these steps. Step 1 of 2 Open and follow the guide to publish and deploy the Nerdpack to New Relic One and subscribe accounts to it. Step 2 of 2 Then you can add your visualization to a dashboard. Summary Congratulations on completing the steps in this example! You've learned how to: Create a visualization and run it locally Quickly test and iterate on visualization code changes in Custom Visualizations Deploy a visualization Add a custom visualization to a dashboard",

      "info": "How to use charts in your NR1 app.",
      "body": "In your application, you can display data in charts, like those used elsewhere in New Relic's user interface. The New Relic One SDK provides React components for different chart types. Once you decide the kind of data you want to present, either from New Relic or some other source, you supply that data to your chart, using props. Query New Relic data In some cases, you want to fetch data from New Relic's database. For example, you may want to display a line chart which plots the number of transactions your application receives over time. With your chart component, set the accountId and query props to query your New Relic data using NRQL: <LineChart accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" />; Copy Alternatively, you can fetch data with a NrqlQuery and set the data prop: <NrqlQuery accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\"> {({ data }) => <LineChart data={data} />} </NrqlQuery>; Copy If you're looking to visualize New Relic data, such as your web application's response times or your server's throughput, querying data in your charts is the way to go. But what if you want to create charts that aren't focused on New Relic data? The data prop is flexible enough that you can supply any arbitrary data, as long as it matches the standardized format. Craft custom data Whether you use custom data sets or the results of a NrqlQuery, a chart's data prop must be an array of objects where each object has both of the following fields: metadata: Defines how the chart presents its data data: An array of data points that appear on the chart For example, create a chart consisting of a line between two points by supplying two x-y coordinates in its data field: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy This LineChart plots a line between coordinates (0, 0) and (20, 10). Use x-y coordinates for all two-dimensional chart formats. For other formats, which you'll learn more about later, use other types of data points. Because data accepts an array, you can supply two series to the same chart: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'series-2', name: 'My second series', viz: 'main', color: 'red', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 50, }, { x: 20, y: 100, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy In this example, you create a single chart with two series. The first series contains the line from the last example. The second series contains a line between points (0, 50) and (20, 100). When using two series in a single chart, like this, you may want to define how the chart represents each series. Use metadata to define those elements. Metadata A series's metadata defines certain features of the series, itself, such as how it should be displayed in your chart. metadata consists of the following attributes: Attribute Description id The series's identifier. Two series having the same id are considered the same series, regardless of where they are located. In general, use a unique id for each series. However, if you use the same series for multiple charts, keeping the id consistent can help with some cross-chart functionality, like simultaneously highlighting multiple charts. name The series's name. name is used in legends, tooltips, and other areas to indicate which series you’re looking at. color The series's color. Most visualizations use this value to differentiate series. Some visualizations, like BillboardChart or JsonChart, ignore it. Use any valid CSS color representation, such as #RRGGBB, hsl(HHH, SS%, LL%), or rgba(RR, GG, BB, .AA). Avoid tweaking the alpha value, when possible, because charts use alpha to highlight or dim certain series. viz The series's visual style. While you most often use main, this field accepts several options: main: Show the series based on chart's type. For instance, a LineChart shows the series as a line, and an AreaChart shows the series as an area. line: Show the series as a line, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to AreaChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. area: Show the series as an area, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to LineChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. event: Show the series as an event, regardless of the chart's type. Charts represent an event as a vertical area behind the main visualization. Events are often used to show alerts. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. target-line: Show the series as a vertical line. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. units_data You can assign a unit type to each axis on a chart. The chart will present data according to the unit type you set with units_data. To set unit_data, pass a JSON object with maps the axis to one of the following unit types: UNKNOWN: The chart displays the series with no special units. COUNT: Each value in the chart represents a count. The chart formats values with their International System prefix. For example, \"k\" represents thousands, \"M\" represents millions, and \"G\" represents billions. PERCENTAGE: Each value in the chart represents a percentage. Typically, you provide values ranging from 0 to 1. The chart formats a value of 1 as \"100%\", a value of 2 as \"200%\", and a value of 0.01 as \"1%\". MS: Each value in the chart represents some number of milliseconds. The chart represents values higher than 1 as a human-readable time duration. For example, 60000 is represented as \"1 minute\". The chart represents values lower than 1 using SI prefixes. For example, 0.001 is represented as 1 μs. TIMESTAMP: Each value in the chart represents a timestamp, the number milliseconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the UNIX Epoch. The chart formats each value as a date. BITS: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits. The chart formats these values using \"b\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb\". BITS_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits per second. The chart formats these values using \"b/s\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb/s\". BYTES: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes. The chart formats these values using \"B\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB\". BYTES_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes per second. The chart formats these values using \"B/s\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB/s\". So, to represent the y-axis for your series in bits, set the y-value in units_data: { \"units_data\": { \"y\": \"BITS\" } } Data While a data series can contain any arbitrary values, a chart only uses values which adhere to its type. So, create your data points according to the chart type: Series Type Example Description Unidimensional [{ \"y\": 10 }, { \"y\": 20 }] The chart plots data points using y values. Use this format with BarChart, BillboardChart, PieChart, StackedBarChart. Two-dimensional [ { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 30 } ] The chart plots data points using x and y values. Use this format with AreaChart, LineChart, ScatterChart, SparklineChart, Funnel [{ \"label1\": 10, \"label2\": 20 }] The chart plots data according to labels. Use this format with FunnelChart. Table [{ \"jobType\": \"SIMPLE\", \"count\": 18 }] The chart plots data according to table columns. You must specify table columns in the metadata. Use this format with TableChart. Event [ { \"x0\": 0, \"x1\": 5 }, { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 15 } ] The chart plots the event's width based on x0 and x1 values. Histogram [ { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 20, \"y\": 100 }, { \"x0\": 30, \"x1\": 40, \"y\": 150 } ] The chart plots the series's width based on x0 and x1 and height based on y. Use this format with HistogramChart and HeatmapChart. Tip JsonChart is a special case because it processes any valid data. For example, you can set an arbitrary JSON object for the chart's data: const data = { data: [ { id: 1, name: 'Foo', price: 123, tags: ['Bar', 'Eek'], stock: { warehouse: 300, retail: 20, } } ], } <JsonChart data={data} /> Copy Special States In previous sections, you learned that a chart's data is an array of series. But you can use special values to present special chart states: null or undefined: Indicates the chart is “loading” its data. In this state, the chart shows a placeholder data set. []: Indicates there is no data to show. The chart states, \"No chart data available\". Configure your chart As you've seen, you use query or data to supply data to your chart, but you can configure other aspects of your chart, too, such as visual settings and click and hover event listeners. Read the documentation for the chart you're using for more specific information. Chart Groups Under some circumstances, you might want to synchronize events, such as dragging or scrubbing, across multiple charts. To do this, use a ChartGroup. All charts in a ChartGroup synchronize their events: <ChartGroup> <Stack> <StackItem> <LineChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\" /> </StackItem> <StackItem> <AreaChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Synthetics SINCE 1 day ago\" /> </StackItem> </Stack> </ChartGroup>; Copy Ideally, group charts that are conceptually related, and separate charts that are conceptually unrelated. Next Step Read the documentation specific to the chart you'd like to use to learn specifics about that chart's behavior and configuration.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

Clicking this gives you access to various account-related abilities. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. Tier may also refer to our pricing tiers. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service.

New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and back-end APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the back-end APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role that has that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload.

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires a Pro or Enterprise FSO tier. If you are in a standard tier, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the Entity Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade your tier. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

View and connect the performance of your entities The New Relic Explorer brings together data reported by any entity from across all of your New Relic accounts. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Workloads, your customized entity groupings. Containers, such as Kubernetes or Docker. Synthetic monitors, for simulations. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. To use the New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Explorer. one.newrelic.com > Explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor.

Read more about New Relic Lookout. Tip You can modify the color palette to focus on clusters of interest. Understand the state of your system with the health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded health status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Important Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter entities using the filterbar The filterbar lets you select the entities displayed according to the conditions you enter: Type in a string of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the entity, the entity type, account ID, environment, or a tag. Tip Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background. If you filter using a string, the filter will have the = operator. If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (=, !=, LIKE, NOT_LIKE, IN, NOT IN) for your filter. Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item. To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, AND or OR. Use AND to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, entityType = Services AND location = APAC. Note that entityType = Services AND entityType = Hosts doesn’t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition. Use OR to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter entityType = Services OR entityType = Hosts returns every entity you have access to that is of type Services or Hosts. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.",

      "body": "Important As of March 22, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries and charts. Now we have New Relic One, which has its own query builder experience. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience compared to Insights. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features Why it's easy to switch to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Improved features in New Relic One New Relic One is an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights. Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights. Features include: Better querying and charting experiences, including a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL Better display options that are easier to understand, especially with dense, line-heavy charts and a better TV mode More charts or widgets across dashboards (up to 12 now, instead of Insights' 3-across limit Easier creation of dashboards with multiple pages (previously called data apps in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Improved experience for querying metric data, both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data Easy customization for your visualizations Try out New Relic One It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the recommendations before you do. Then, to view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click Try new dashboards. Recommendations The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation: Important If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards. If you create some types of dashboards in New Relic One, their improved features may lose functionality when edited in Insights. These include: Dashboards created using the Insights metric explorer. When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights. Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One. New customization features result in incompatibilities between New Relic One and Insights charts. Also: Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called Data apps. When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the Data apps section. Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following Manage data UI pages will remain in Insights for now: Summary UI page Add data UI page Embeddables UI page Lookup tables UI page API keys UI page Formatter UI page To find these pages: go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data Learn more For a more detailed look of New Relic One dashboard features, see this Explorers Hub post.
