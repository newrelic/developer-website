      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account, and to have Node.js installed on your machine. See [Setting up your development environment](/build-apps/set-up-dev-env) for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps*, and then in the Other apps section, you should see a Create a table** launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

A user channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. A device is registered if the user has logged into New Relic using the mobile app on the device. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.

      "body": "In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and alert conditions violations, and replacing these pages with a new synthetic monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. For more information, check the EoL Announcements page. If you want to receive alert notifications when a synthetic monitor fails, you can configure the alert notification either while creating a monitor or after you have created one. You can configure your monitor's alert policy directly from the Synthetics UI or via the Alerts UI for existing monitors. To identify which monitors do not have policies assigned to them, review their color-coded health status. Add a synthetic monitor to alert policies A monitor can be included in multiple alert policies. You can view the alert policies and conditions for the selected monitor from the Synthetics UI or from the Alerts UI. To add an existing monitor to an alert policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate one or more alert policies where the monitor has not already been added. Open the policy, then click Add a condition. Click Synthetics and then select the monitor. Fill out the remaining settings and click Create condition. Existing monitor: Remove from alert policy To remove an existing monitor from an existing alert policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate one or more alert policies where the monitor has not already been added. Select the trash can (delete) icon on the monitor's row. Receive alert notifications on a three-strike basis Synthetic alert notifications operate on a three-strike basis, sending an alert after three monitor attempts from a single location return an error. Your alert policy configuration and notification channel settings will determine when you receive alerts for specific monitors and locations. If you monitor a non-public app and add your selected public minion IPs to your allow list, you may very infrequently receive a false downtime alert. When a synthetic monitoring data center goes down, New Relic may decide to temporarily use an alternate host, which results in the temporary server's IP being blocked by your app. Mute (disable) monitor's alert notifications To temporarily disable alerting for a monitor, mute it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Monitors > (select a monitor). Click General under the Settings menu in the left menu sidebar. Click the Notifications button to Off. Muting a monitor's alert notifications will not mute multi-location alerts or NRQL alerts.

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT Thank you for your interest in contributing to the open source projects of New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, New Relic must have a Contributor License Agreement (\"Agreement\") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This Agreement is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of New Relic; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to New Relic. Except for the licenses granted herein to New Relic and recipients of software distributed by New Relic, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions. Definitions. \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is entering into this Agreement with New Relic. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. \"Contribution\" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to New Relic for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products managed or maintained by New Relic (the \"Work\"). For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to New Relic or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, New Relic for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as \"Not a Contribution.\" Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to New Relic and to recipients of software distributed by New Relic a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to New Relic and to recipients of software distributed by New Relic a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to New Relic, or that Your employer has executed a separate Agreement with New Relic. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to New Relic separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as \"Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here] \". You agree to notify New Relic of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

      "body": "Proprietary license New Relic Diagnostics license terms These New Relic Diagnostics License Terms (“Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions under which you (“Customer”) may use New Relic Diagnostics (the “Software”), as made available by New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”). By clicking “accept” or downloading or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your company, then “Customer” means your company and you are binding your company to these Terms. 1. License Grant. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms, New Relic grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software in accordance with its documentation in support of Customer’s use of New Relic products to which Customer has a separate subscription (“New Relic Products”). Unless otherwise specified, there is no fee for use of the Software. 2. License Restrictions. Customer will not (a) sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, time-share or otherwise provide access to any copies of the Software, or portions thereof, to a third party; (b) modify, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software; (c) use the Software to develop services or products for sale or include any components of the Software in any product; (d) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices in the Software; or (e) publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including benchmarks) relating to the Software. 3. Ownership. Except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, New Relic and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, and all copies, updates, modifications and derivative works thereof. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under these Terms or otherwise. 4. Usage Data. Customer agrees that New Relic and its affiliates have the right to collect Usage Data from Customer through the Software and use Usage Data to support, operate and improve New Relic products and services and for other lawful business purposes. “Usage Data” means diagnostics data related to the use of the Software with New Relic Products, including, without limitation, configuration information, details on diagnostics tasks, New Relic account and application ID numbers and New Relic license keys. For clarity, Usage Data is not considered “Customer Data”, “your Data” or any other similar term as used in any applicable subscription or license agreement for New Relic Products. At Customer’s election, Customer may disable the collection of Usage Data as described in the Software documentation. 5. Disclaimers. New Relic is not obligated to provide any support or maintenance for the Software. ALL USE OF SOFTWARE IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK. SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, HOWEVER, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE AT APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED $50. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND NEW RELIC WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 7. Changes and Termination. At its discretion, without notice or liability to Customer, New Relic may (a) update, modify or discontinue the Software; (b) modify these Terms, effective upon posting; or (c) terminate or suspend these Terms or Customer’s access to the Software. If Customer does not agree with any modification, its sole remedy is to terminate its use of the Software. Upon any termination or suspension, Customer must stop using the Software. 8. Third Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with third party code (including code which may be made available to Customer in source code form). A list of third party code and ownership, use, warranty and modification rights with respect to such code may be identified in the documentation or provided by New Relic upon Customer’s written request. New Relic is not responsible for applications and services not licensed by New Relic. 9. Export Compliance. Customer acknowledges that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the U.S. government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Customer shall not remove or export from the U.S. or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any U.S. or foreign agency or authority. Customer agrees to the foregoing and warrants that Customer is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. 10. Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software. If Customer is an entity of the U.S. government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, is restricted by a license agreement or by these Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Software was developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. 11. General. These Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the U.S. without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California. The parties are independent contractors. Customer may not assign these Terms without New Relic’s prior written consent and any attempt to do so will be void; New Relic may assign these Terms freely to any party without Customer’s consent. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in effect. These Terms are the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Software, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements (oral or written) relating to the Software. Any separate agreement Customer has for New Relic Products does not apply to the Software. Open-source licenses We love open-source software, and use the following in New Relic Diagnostics.

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query and chart builder experience. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. For more information, see our blog post about crash analysis. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Leverage our metric-based alerts and New Relic Mobile UI. Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the Mobile UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if monitored by New Relic Browser), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. New Relic Mobile tracks the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "Quickly tag a set of resources 5 min Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us # Set the profile as default newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Copy Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Note Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. # Adding a single tag newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value # Adding multiple tags newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "info": "Explore NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, and build the queries you need.",
      "body": "Explore NerdGraph using the API Explorer 25 min NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic API key. You can create one directly from the NerdGraph API Explorer. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. # curl version curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' # New Relic CLI version newrelic nerdgraph query '{ actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } ' Copy Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

Command Description nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. Command details nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output.",

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Read on to learn about the New Relic containerized private minion (CPM), a Docker container-based private minion that accepts and executes synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.

Quick start To get started right away: Learn: Check out the different types of distributed tracing with New Relic. Enable: See how to set up distributed tracing. Use: View your traces in the UI after you enable distributed tracing. Why distributed tracing matters When you can see software requests end-to-end, troubleshooting is easier and faster. Distributed tracing does this by showing you the path a request follows as it travels through a distributed system. As requests travel between services, each segment is recorded as a span, which represents time spent in services or resources of those services. All the spans of a request are combined into a single distributed trace to give you a picture of an entire request. Once your traces are captured in New Relic, you can use our powerful tools to analyze them: Filter results: You can filter charts using many data points, so you can analyze trace data in different ways. Detect anomalous spans: Spans that are slow in comparison to typical behavior are marked as anomalous, with charts comparing them to typical instances. Customize queries and dashboards: You can create custom queries of your trace data and create custom data dashboards. See data across accounts: See a global view of traces from across all your accounts and applications. Query traces programmatically: Query distributed trace data by using GraphQL in our NerdGraph API explorer.

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contributing to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Other apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

The quick start automatically generates an API key for the account you select, and gives you the pre-populated commands to create a profile, generate your first \"Hello World\" app, and serve it locally. Tip Use the NR1 VS Code extension to build your apps. New Relic One CLI Commands This table provides descriptions for the New Relic One commands. For more context, including usage and option details, click any individual command or the command category. For details on user permissions, see Authentication and permissions.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contributing to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally.

      "body": "Collect data from any source 15 min New Relic products report a lot of data “out of the box.” When you use products like APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure monitoring, or an integration, by default you receive performance data. But you may want to bring data into New Relic that isn't collected by default. Maybe you want an API-based solution that doesn't require install of an agent. Maybe you want to bring telemetry data from another analysis service into New Relic. This page describes several ways to get data into New Relic. Step 1 of 6 Agent APIs If you use our APM, Browser, or Mobile agents to report data, you can use their associated APIs to report custom data. For example, if you monitor your application with the our APM Python agent, you can use the Python agent API to set up custom instrumentation. See the agent APIs. Step 2 of 6 Telemetry SDK Our Telemetry SDKs are language wrappers for our Trace API and Metric API (and eventually our Log API and Event API). These SDKs let you easily send metrics and trace data to New Relic without needing to install an agent. For customers, we offer open-source exporters and integrations that use the Telemetry SDKs to send metrics and trace data: Istio adaptor Prometheus OpenMetrics (for Docker | for Kubernetes) OpenCensus exporter (for Go | for Python) DropWizard exporter Micrometer exporter Want to build your own solution? See our Telemetry SDK docs. Step 3 of 6 Trace API Our Trace API lets you send distributed tracing data to New Relic and consolidate tracing data from multiple sources in one place. We accept trace data in two formats: Zipkin format New Relic format (if you don’t have Zipkin-format data, you’d use this) 1 curl -i -X POST https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ 5 -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ 6 -d '[ 7 { 8 \"common\": { 9 \"attributes\": { 10 \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", 11 \"host\": \"host123.test.com\" 12 } 13 }, 14 \"spans\": [ 15 { 16 \"trace.id\": \"123456\", 17 \"id\": \"ABC\", 18 \"attributes\": { 19 \"duration.ms\": 12.53, 20 \"name\": \"/home\" 21 } 22 }, 23 { 24 \"trace.id\": \"123456\", 25 \"id\": \"DEF\", 26 \"attributes\": { 27 \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", 28 \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", 29 \"duration.ms\": 2.97, 30 \"name\": \"/auth\", 31 \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" 32 } 33 } 34 ] 35 } 36 ]' Copy Step 4 of 6 Metric API You can use our Metric API to send metric data to New Relic from any source. 1 curl -i -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 { 6 \"metrics\": [ 7 { 8 \"name\": \"memory.heap\", 9 \"type\": \"gauge\", 10 \"value\": 2.3, 11 \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, 12 \"attributes\": { 13 \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" 14 } 15 } 16 ] 17 } 18 ]' Copy Step 5 of 6 Event API For sending arbitrary events to New Relic, you can use our Event API. We save these events as a new event type, which can then be queried via NRQL. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Event API.) 1 curl -i -X POST https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/events \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"x-insert-key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 { 6 \"eventType\": \"LoginEvent\", 7 \"service\": \"login-service\", 8 \"customerId\": \"xyz\" 9 } 10 ]' Copy Step 6 of 6 Log API If our existing logging integrations don’t meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send any arbitrary log data to New Relic. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Log API.) 1 curl -i -X POST https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 \"logs\": [ 6 { 7 \"timestamp\": 1593538496000, 8 \"message\": \"User xyz logged in\", 9 \"service\": \"login-service\", 10 \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" 11 } 12 ] 13 ]' Copy",

The data displayed in the UI is a combination of these data sources. For example, the Overview page displays data reported by instrumentation, while the Metrics page displays CloudWatch data. Event definitions and attributes Lambda data is stored in our database (NRDB) as events (data objects with associated attributes). Lambda data is attached to the following event types. Select an event name to see its attributes. AwsLambdaInvocation event: Captures overall timing and associated metadata. A Lambda invocation generates a single AwsLambdaInvocation event. AwsLambdaInvocationError event: If an error occurs during a Lambda, this event will be generated. Span: This includes detail about a segment of a Lambda function. Spans are used for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing relies on data sampling; 10% of invocations are sampled to generate spans. Custom event types: With some agent APIs, custom events can be created and associated with a particular Lambda invocation, and then queried with NRQL.

      "body": "New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document will explain how to report your own custom events and attributes. Overview of reporting custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data, and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetics Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn about how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see Event data retention.

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us # Set the profile as default newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Copy Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Note Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. # Adding a single tag newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value # Adding multiple tags newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "info": "Explore NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, and build the queries you need.",
      "body": "Explore NerdGraph using the API Explorer 25 min NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic API key. You can create one directly from the NerdGraph API Explorer. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. # curl version curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' # New Relic CLI version newrelic nerdgraph query '{ actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } ' Copy Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

      "body": "Cloud migrations can take many forms. Some companies choose to port their applications directly from their data center to the cloud (a “Lift and Shift” migration) while others focus on completely re-architecting their applications to take advantage of benefits available only in the cloud. No matter your approach, there are three primary questions you want to answer after your migration: Has my application gotten slower? Is my application less stable than before? Am I losing customers due to either of the previous questions? To answer these questions, start by performing some basic testing to establish a baseline for the performance and availability of your systems. A baseline is a measurement of the current performance and availability of your application, which you then use as a comparison after your migration to validate your business case. In some cases, you may change a baseline when you perform migration acceptance testing. You can also use a baseline as a comparison point during your migration to make sure that you are on track. 1. Identify components Before you begin a cloud migration, identify all the tiers of your entire application stack. List all of the components (applications, services, etc.) that you want to migrate. Segment the application stack as follows: Application (backend/microservices/cron jobs) Dependency services, such as the message queue Database Website Underlying server and infrastructure Make sure that you have access to applications and instances before you start creating application baselines. Engage your application owners, DevOps engineers, and product managers for access. Example: List of components Here is an example of the list of components in an application stack: Component Name Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet, Intranet) Operating System Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 RabbitMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 MS SQL Dave Z NA Intranet Win2003 R2 2. Determine compatibility Once you identify the applications that you want to migrate, it is time to verify which application tiers to monitor with the New Relic platform. Work with stakeholders in your organization to determine the amount of instrumentation that is possible–or allowed–within your organization. This is an important step and one that will pay off, as the more you can instrument, the better your baselines. Here are the New Relic products to use for baselining, depending on the components that you identified: New Relic APM: Monitor your web apps with New Relic APM. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products to learn precise compatibility details for each supported language. New Relic Infrastructure: Monitor your hosts with New Relic Infrastructure. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic Infrastructure for supported operating systems and environments. You can also instrument other products and services with on-host integrations. New Relic Synthetics: Monitor web frontends and APIs with New Relic Synthetics. Sometimes, you may not be able to instrument your on-premise environment with APM or Infrastructure. For example, maybe your organization's policy forbids installing an agent behind a firewall. In these cases, if the application has a web frontend, use Synthetics, as it offers non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. Example: Components matched to New Relic products Match the components that you identified with their corresponding products: Component Name Tier Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet/ Intranet) Operating System New Relic Products Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 APM, Infrastructure, Synthetics Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 APM, Infrastructure ActiveMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX APM, Plugin Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 Synthetics MS SQL Dave Z n/a Intranet Win2003 R2 Infrastructure, On-host Integration 3. Deploy monitoring Based on the component-product matches you made, deploy agents or monitors across your architecture: Deploy New Relic APM Install the APM agent on your application stack. The steps to install the APM agent are different based on language. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, follow the instructions to install the Infrastructure agent on your hosts: Install for Linux Install for Windows Server Install on AWS Elastic Beanstalk Install with a configuration management tool Deploy Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations. Available integrations include Apache, MySQL, NGINX, and others. Create New Relic Synthetics monitors New Relic Synthetics is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. To get started add a monitor. Make sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the public network. You may also need to add New Relic IPs to your allow list. 4. Gather metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, identify which metrics are the most important to your business and use these metrics to define your KPIs. Some recommendations include: Response time: Time taken to respond to a request. Throughput: Number of requests that came in through the application. Requesting queuing (Apache, IIS, NGINX): Duration of time taken for a request to reach your application. Database call duration: Duration of time taken to complete a database call. DB call counts: Number of calls made by application code to the database. Error rate: Percent of errors reported. Apdex score: An industry standard to measure user satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. DNS setup timing: The time it takes to connect and receive data from DNS. SSL setup timing: The time it takes to establish an SSL connection. You can find some of these metrics in service maps, as well as on APM, and Browser overview pages. For more detailed information about navigating, interpreting, and using New Relic APM, check out these New Relic University’s tutorials: Overview dashboard tour Transactions dashboard Understanding Apdex 5. Set up Dashboards After you define your KPIs, it is easy to visualize them in New Relic Dashboards. Dashboards provide a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Dashboards data consists of events, and each event has an event type, a timestamp, and key-value attributes. For more information about events, see Data collection and Default events for New Relic products. You can locate your KPIs and business metrics data in New Relic using the data explorer and the NRQL query language. You can also build Dashboards to track the performance of those KPIs: Example: Component performance compared against baselines Continuing the examples in this document, the following table illustrates the maturity of your application performance over a period of time based on deployment milestones. Each milestone will serve as a new baseline for your applications: Component Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Milestone N Environment Component Name Response Time SLA Apdex Response Time SLA Apdex Response On-Prem Service 1 1.5 secs 80% 70% 1.5 secs 68% 0.65 1.4 secs Cloud Service 1 0.9 secs 96.8% 95% 0.9 secs 98% 0.99 0.7 secs On-Prem Service 2 0.7 secs 73% 68% 0.7 secs 80% 0.78 0.85 secs Cloud Service 2 0.6 secs 90% 92% 0.6 secs 89% 0.90 0.5 secs After your migration, compare these baselines against your migration acceptance testing baselines. Expert tips If you find that you need data that is not captured by default instrumentation, New Relic makes it easy to capture custom data: APM custom instrumentation Browser custom data Infrastructure custom attributes Custom event data Mobile custom data Synthetics custom attributes You can also learn more about APM custom instrumentation with the New Relic University Custom data tutorial series.

Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to install, use, troubleshoot, and uninstall it. After you install a plugin, it starts to receive data, usually within five minutes. The plugin automatically appears with a short name and icon on your Plugins menu in New Relic One. You do not need to select it from Plugin Central. Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the EU region data center. View plugin dashboard details The amount and types of information on the plugin's summary page and dashboards depend on the specific plugin. For example, a plugin may have one or more components (instances) and one or more dashboards. To view summary and dashboard details about the plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, review the list of components or instances, summary metrics, and list of Recent Events. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select its name. Plugin summary Depending on the plugin, the summary includes: One or more components or instances (what the plugin agent is monitoring, typically a host/port pair) Zero to five summary metrics for the past three minutes (values such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count) with optional alerts Recent events list, including deployments, notifications, and alerts Other information about alert violations, events, and activity If your plugin has 100 or more components or instances, you can search for a specific component instance. Here is a summary of additional standard features. If you want to... Do this... View version information for a component's or instance's agent Mouse over the component's name. Change the sort order On the title row of the plugin's summary page, select the up or down arrow for a component (instance) or a summary metric's label.

View page details for a component or instance Select the name or a summary metric for the component (instance). Plugin dashboards Depending on the plugin, it may have one or more dashboards, and each dashboard may present data as a chart or a table. You can use any of New Relic's standard dashboard features to drill down into detailed information. The customized dashboards that show plugin data are part of the plugin. Users cannot add or remove these dashboards. This must be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin update. Plugin alerts If the plugin publisher set Critical (red) or Caution (yellow) alert conditions for your plugin's components or instances, you can view details direct in the user interface. For example, you can: Select and view alert details. Change the existing thresholds. Set your alert notification options; for example, to receive email notifications for Critical events. Delete a plugin Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to uninstall it. When you select the plugin's Download or Continue button, the plugin should include a README file or refer to other documentation resources. Remove plugin components (instances) At a minimum, your plugin must stop reporting data before you start uninstalling it. Make sure the health status for your plugin's components (instances) are gray. Depending on the plugin, there may be other dependencies before disabling or uninstalling it. For example, plugins from SaaS providers may have different requirements. Be sure to review the instructions that the plugin's publisher provides. Then, to remove individual components from your plugin, click the settings settings icon for each component (instance). Delete the plugin After you remove each component (instance) for the plugin, the plugin icon will automatically disappear from your Plugins menu in the New Relic UI. You do not need to do anything else to delete the plugin. If you are the plugin's publisher and need to delete the plugin from Plugin Central, go to support.newrelic.com.

      "body": "New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document will explain how to report your own custom events and attributes. Overview of reporting custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data, and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetics Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn about how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see Event data retention.

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: APM's weekly performance reports are not available in the EU region. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported in the EU region. Deprecated products and features are not available in the EU region. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the U.S. Whether you store your data in New Relic’s U.S. region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the U.S. region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For standard accounts, you can only have one master account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with sub-accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a master account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new master account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the master account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a master account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Application performance data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process application performance data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Retrieve data from New Relic. Send data to New Relic. Adjust settings. This section of the docs provides examples and reference documentation for our API endpoints. For developer-focused content on how to use and customize New Relic, see developer.newrelic.com. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. New Relic provides a powerful GraphQL tool to explore the API with embedded schema definitions. To get started, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For sample queries and mutations, use our NerdGraph tutorials. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The Browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the Browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To retrieve browser monitoring data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To retrieve infrastructure data, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To retrieve Mobile data from New Relic, use the Query API. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To retrieve synthetics event data, use the Query API. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users. Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. If you implemented the REST API for querying subscription usage data prior to July 10, 2018, those usage-related REST APIs are now deprecated. You should use the Query API, which requires creating an API key. For more on switching to the new API format, see the transition guide. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights API resources for Insights include: Resource Details Insert events API To report custom data use the Event insertion API. Query API To query your Insights data using NRQL-formatted queries, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Dashboard API To create, read, update, and delete dashboards, use the Dashboard API. Other New Relic product APIs You can also report custom data from other New Relic features. For more information, see the API sections for other products. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query data with NRQL. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "[RSS] Released on:  Wednesday, February 15, 2017 - 09:55 Download Improvements APIs This release adds a number of APIs that will allow you to instrument and get expanded visibility into frameworks, libraries, and any custom code that New Relic does not automatically instrument. In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers. This fix brings the Java Agent into compliance with the behavior of other New Relic Agents. Fixes an issue in which custom Hystrix Commands that are subclassed multiple times in Groovy cause an application to throw an exception on startup.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other entities, see Obtain references. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other entities, see Obtain references. Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Implement cross application tracing To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic entities. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic entities. Obtain references to New Relic entities Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the first call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record Insights custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic entities.

      "body": "newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Used to instrument functions, methods, generators, and coroutines that aren't instrumented by default. Description function_trace is a decorator for adding to functions, methods, generators, and coroutines. Adding this decorator lets you collect additional transaction information (including transaction trace information). (An alternate way to instrument functions without having to touch your app code is to list them in the config file.) function_trace does not give you a full profile of all the functions that happen in a decorated function. What it does is add the decorated function as a node in the New Relic UI and capture the time spent in that function. If you need more detail about what is going on in that function, you would need to also apply the function trace to the function's child functions. The function_trace decorator can be used on generators and coroutines with agent version 2.102.0.85 or higher. Timing of these objects begins when consumption starts, and ends when the object is exhausted or goes out of scope. This is a change from earlier versions where the metric represented the time taken to create the generator or coroutine object itself. You can use the decorator in conjunction with existing decorators, including those for static and class methods. When nesting multiple decorators, have the function_trace decorator as the outermost decorator. For any decorators that are being wrapped, use functools.wraps() from the Python standard library in their implementation. (Or, otherwise ensure that the decorator propagates the correct name attributes of the innermost wrapped object required to allow correct name introspection.) If this is not done, then when the metric is reported, the name of the nested decorator function (not the innermost wrapped function) will be used. Alternate call forms For setups where you cannot use the decorator, these alternate call forms are available: The context manager The FunctionTrace context manager is used when the parameters to be passed cannot be determined before runtime. (For example, you may not know the name of a function at import time.) When using the context manager to name a metric, you must always supply the name and the metric path prefix. The FunctionTrace class implements the context manager and is used in conjunction with the with statement. The FunctionTrace class is the lowest level primitive available for tracing time against a transaction. The with statement defines the bounds of what is timed and not a single function. Thus, the context manager could be applied to an arbitrary block of code. The block of code could therefore contain calls to multiple functions, or it could be a self-contained block of code implementing a time-oriented algorithm that you want to track. Avoid tracing blocks of code that are called an excessive number of times. For example, do not use it within the context of a loop that executes many times. The data generated will incur a performance overhead. A better solution is to enclose the loop. The wrapper If you know in advance where the specific functions you want to trace are, you could use the function_trace decorator. However, if you don't know all the functions that need to be traced (for example, if they're being looked up dynamically as part of a routing system), then you must use the FunctionTraceWrapper to wrap the function at the time of registration or at the time of calling. Path-based wrapping wrap_function_trace is used for wrapping functions outside of the code they're declared in. For example: you might use this to instrument library code that you don't want to modify. For more about the differences between these call formats, see Different call formats. Parameters Parameters for decorator newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) This call includes these parameters: Parameter Description name string Optional. The function name. If not set, defaults to the captured name of the function. group string Optional. The group represents the naming structure for the name parameter. This is used in the UI for segregating the transaction types. If not supplied, the group will default to Function in expectation that the name is of the form module:class.function or module:function and represents the name of the function being executed. If you are creating a custom group, it's recommended you prefix it with Python/. label string Optional. Adds a callout-style flag to the segment in a transaction trace. Default is None. params dict Optional. Custom parameters to add to the segment in transaction traces. terminal boolean Optional. If true, no children segments will be recorded. Default is False. Parameters for context manager newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace(name, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Parameters for the context manager includes all of the parameters from function_trace. The name parameter is required and not optional. Parameter Description name string Required. The function name. Wrapper parameters newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(wrapped, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Parameters for the wrapper include all parameters for function_trace and a wrapped parameter: Parameter Description wrapped function Required. The function being wrapped. Path-based wrapping parameters newrelic.agent.wrap_function_trace(module, object_path, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Parameters include all parameters for function_trace and these parameters: Parameter Description module object Required. The module containing the function to be instrumented. object_path string The path to the location of the function. Example(s) function_trace example An example of using the function_trace decorator: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... An example of using the function_trace decorator with native coroutines: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... Context manager example An example of using the FunctionTrace context manager: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) with newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace( endpoint, 'Python/EndPoint'): return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Wrapper example An example of using the FunctionTraceWrapper: URL routing with Werkzeug yields a name that is used first to dynamically look up a method of a class using getattr() and the result then invoked: def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() return getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint)(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e If you want to trace the endpoint function, you can rewrite this as: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(function) return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e If you want to name the metric after the endpoint name (rather than naming the metric based on the identifier for the function being called), you can supply the name to use plus an alternate metric path prefix when the FunctionTraceWrapper object is created. import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper( function, name=endpoint, group='Python/EndPoint') return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e For this example, if the endpoint were called help, the final metric would be: Python/EndPoint/help In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category would be Python and the segment name EndPoint/help. That segment name would also appear in slow transaction traces as the node name.",

      "body": "You can use baseline conditions to define violation thresholds that adjust to the behavior of your data. Baseline alerting is useful for creating conditions that: Only notify you when data is behaving abnormally. Dynamically adjust to changing data and trend s, including daily or weekly trends. In addition, baseline alerting works well with new applications when you do not yet have known behaviors. How it works When you choose a data source (for example, an APM metric) for a baseline condition, we'll use the past values of that data to dynamically predict the data's near-future behavior. The line of that predicted future behavior for that value is called a baseline. It appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the baseline condition UI. You'll use the baseline alert condition UI to: Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source. Set the behavior that will trigger a violation (for example: \"deviating for more than five minutes\"). Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both. When your data escapes the predicted \"normal\" behavior and meets the criteria you've chosen, you'll receive a notification. Set baseline thresholds one.newrelic.com > AI & Alerts > Policies > (create or select policy) > Create alert condition: Baseline alert conditions give you the ability to set intelligent, self-adjusting thresholds that only generate violations when abnormal behavior is detected. To create a baseline condition: When you start to create a condition, choose one of the following data sources: APM: Application metric baseline Browser: Metric baseline NRQL (and then choose a baseline type threshold) Here are some tips for setting baseline thresholds: Set the baseline direction to monitor violations that happen either above or below the baseline. Set the preview chart to either 2 days or 7 days of displayed data. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Use the slider bar to adjust the Critical threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the baseline. The tighter the band around the baseline, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate. Optional: You can create a Warning threshold (the darker gray area around the baseline). For NRQL alerts, see the allowed types of NRQL queries. If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Baseline rules and settings Here are some details about how the UI works: Rules governing creation of baseline The algorithm for baseline conditions is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities: Data trait Baseline rules Age of data On initial creation, the baseline is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and baseline type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the baseline will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the baseline and thresholds will become. Consistency of data For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the baseline. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds. Regular fluctuations For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the baseline algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them. Baseline direction: select upper or lower ranges You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the baseline (\"upper\") or that goes below the baseline (\"lower\"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the Baseline direction selector. Example use cases for this: You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down. You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem. Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different baseline direction settings. The red areas represent violations. Preview chart: select 2 or 7 days When setting thresholds, the preview chart has an option for displaying Since 2 days ago or Since 7 days ago. These selections are not the time period used to compute the baseline; they are only the time range used for a preview display. For more about the time range used to calculate the baseline, see the algorithm rules.

Create a description For some condition types, you can create a Description. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option.

Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Offset the query time window Every minute, we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows. The start time depends on the value you select in the NRQL condition's Advanced settings > Evaluation offset. Example: Using the default time window to evaluate violations With the Evaluation offset at the default setting of three minutes, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend evaluating data from three minutes ago or longer. An offset of less than 3 minutes will trigger violations sooner, but you might see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Create a description You can define a description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by downstream systems.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us # Set the profile as default newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Copy Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Note Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. # Adding a single tag newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value # Adding multiple tags newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Developers are creating new and innovative apps that extend and enhance your data views. From New Relic One's apps page, you can subscribe to apps you create, publish, and deploy, as well as those created by New Relic engineers and other organizations. You can also launch the apps you subscribe to. Just select Apps from the New Relic One home page to see what's available. one.newrelic.com > Apps: Under the New Relic One catalog section, you can subscribe to applications. Create and share open source apps The Other apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide information we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Other apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. If you’ve started to develop applications on the New Relic One platform, you probably want to share them with your broader organization. That’s where the catalog comes in. When you publish and deploy your app, it’s available to you in the catalog. You can manage the information that you want to share about your application, as well as how it appears on the New Relic One app page. You can also subscribe accounts to it. Permission for managing applications User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on: New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack Manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what the apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local (you made it!), custom, or public. Browser Analyzer app with browser app entity listed, plus duplicate clean up tab. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. When you create an application by running nr1 create, a generic icon.png file is added to your project. Replace this with an icon of your choice, but keep the file name icon.png to update your application's icon in the catalog. 1. Update the New Relic One CLI Make sure you have the latest version of the New Relic One CLI by running nr1 update. 2. Add catalog metadata and screenshots Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following table for the process to succeed. File Requirements screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads & entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n-Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n-Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n-Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n-Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } 3. Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog Run nr1 catalog:submit. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. Subscribe accounts to an application Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: - Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. - Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the Public apps created by New Relic. - Click the update button. Now you and the accounts you subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Unsubscribe to an application On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Other apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Remove duplicates In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contributing to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to install, use, troubleshoot, and uninstall it. After you install a plugin, it starts to receive data, usually within five minutes. The plugin automatically appears with a short name and icon on your Plugins menu in New Relic One. You do not need to select it from Plugin Central. Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the EU region data center. View plugin dashboard details The amount and types of information on the plugin's summary page and dashboards depend on the specific plugin. For example, a plugin may have one or more components (instances) and one or more dashboards. To view summary and dashboard details about the plugin: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Plugins, and select your plugin. From the plugin's summary page, review the list of components or instances, summary metrics, and list of Recent Events. To view dashboard details about any component or instance, select its name. Plugin summary Depending on the plugin, the summary includes: One or more components or instances (what the plugin agent is monitoring, typically a host/port pair) Zero to five summary metrics for the past three minutes (values such as average, total, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, rate, or count) with optional alerts Recent events list, including deployments, notifications, and alerts Other information about alert violations, events, and activity If your plugin has 100 or more components or instances, you can search for a specific component instance. Here is a summary of additional standard features. If you want to... Do this... View version information for a component's or instance's agent Mouse over the component's name.

View page details for a component or instance Select the name or a summary metric for the component (instance). Plugin dashboards Depending on the plugin, it may have one or more dashboards, and each dashboard may present data as a chart or a table. You can use any of New Relic's standard dashboard features to drill down into detailed information. The customized dashboards that show plugin data are part of the plugin. Users cannot add or remove these dashboards. This must be done by the author or publisher as part of a plugin update. Plugin alerts If the plugin publisher set Critical (red) or Caution (yellow) alert conditions for your plugin's components or instances, you can view details direct in the user interface. For example, you can: Select and view alert details. Change the existing thresholds. Set your alert notification options; for example, to receive email notifications for Critical events. Delete a plugin Each plugin in Plugin Central includes procedures for how to uninstall it. When you select the plugin's Download or Continue button, the plugin should include a README file or refer to other documentation resources. Remove plugin components (instances) At a minimum, your plugin must stop reporting data before you start uninstalling it. Make sure the health status for your plugin's components (instances) are gray. Depending on the plugin, there may be other dependencies before disabling or uninstalling it. For example, plugins from SaaS providers may have different requirements. Be sure to review the instructions that the plugin's publisher provides. Then, to remove individual components from your plugin, click the settings settings icon for each component (instance). Delete the plugin After you remove each component (instance) for the plugin, the plugin icon will automatically disappear from your Plugins menu in the New Relic UI. You do not need to do anything else to delete the plugin. If you are the plugin's publisher and need to delete the plugin from Plugin Central, go to support.newrelic.com.

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account, and to have Node.js installed on your machine. See [Setting up your development environment](/build-apps/set-up-dev-env) for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps*, and then in the Other apps section, you should see a Create a table** launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

      "body": "Get started with the New Relic CLI 20 min Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal: you can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. Our CLI has been designed for automating common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic personal API Key, which you can create from the Account settings of your New Relic account An instrumented application in your New Relic account Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI The New Relic CLI can be downloaded via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile Now that you've installed the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Note that you need to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY -r YOUR_REGION # Set the profile as defaults newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 10 Get your application details In this example, you are going to add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 The New Relic CLI can retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application use the apm application search command. If you get an error, check that the account ID and application name you provided are correct. newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Copy Step 5 of 10 If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example. When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. [ { accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, applicationId: YOUR_APP_ID, domain: 'APM', entityType: 'APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY', guid: 'A_LONG_GUID', name: 'NAME_OF_YOUR_APP', permalink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID', reporting: true, type: 'APPLICATION', }, ]; Copy Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Let's suppose that you want to add an environment tag to your application. Go ahead and add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Copy Step 7 of 10 What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets come to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags at once to your application, modify and run the following snippet. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 You've created and added some tags to your application, but how do you know they're there? You need to retrieve your application's tags. To retrieve your application's tags, use the entity tags get command. newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: Create a deployment marker Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same Application ID from your earlier search. newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Copy Step 10 of 10 Notice that the JSON response includes the revision and timestamp of the deployment. This workflow could be built into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to help indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here is an example. { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands.

When you send data to our Trace API, you can add custom attributes to spans. For example, you might decide to add attributes like customer.id or user.id in order to help you analyze your trace data. Some expected attribute values cause our distributed tracing UI to display some specific trace properties and details. For example, if a span has an attribute with an error. prefix, the UI displays that span with an error. For another example, a span with an attribute that has a db. prefix will be displayed as a datastore span in the UI, and will have its datastore query highlighted. Decorating your spans to show specific properties in our UI can help you: Better understand the structure of your trace data. More easily troubleshoot problems. How to decorate your spans with attributes This table explains how to get spans sent to the Trace API to show up with specific properties in the UI. For property descriptions, see span properties.

For example: http.method. A span will also appear as an external if it has a child that comes from a different entity. Datastore Use an attribute with an db. prefix. For example: db.statement. Service This cannot be done with an attribute. A span is classified as a service span if it's the root span, or if its parent is from a different entity. If a span has several properties, service span classification takes precedence in the UI. In-process This cannot be done with an attribute. A span is classified as in-process if it hasn't been classified as a service span, datastore span, or external span. For more on how these span properties are determined and stored, see Trace structure. Tips for adding attributes: You can add any attribute to a span. For example: you might add an attribute like customer.id so that you could search traces globally for traces containing a specific customer. A span can be in multiple categories. For example, external is a more general category than is datastore, so if a span is classified as both external and datastore, it will be indicated as a datastore span in the UI.

      "body": "Explore NerdGraph using the API Explorer 25 min NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic API key. You can create one directly from the NerdGraph API Explorer. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. # curl version curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' # New Relic CLI version newrelic nerdgraph query '{ actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } ' Copy Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

      "body": "This document contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically create and manage several types of New Relic keys. To build queries and see responses, use our GraphiQL explorer. For more information on our API keys, see API keys. Feature description NerdGraph's ApiAccess field can be used to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: Personal API keys License keys, including: General license key used for APM Browser license key One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. General notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Some notes about license keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, the license keys are referred to as ingest keys. This feature allows you to create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. License keys created through NerdGraph can't be found in the New Relic UI. They're only queryable via the API. Some notes about personal API keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, personal API keys are referred to as user keys. User keys are displayed in various UI locations (for example: the User settings UI page). The examples below use license keys (ingest keys), but personal API keys (user keys) are queried in similar ways. We recommend you experiment with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name accountId notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Results will vary depending on your data.

      "body": "One way to understand how your monitored entities relate to each other is through our NerdGraph API. The NerdGraph relationship API captures how pairs of entities interact and how they're related. By using the API, you can troubleshoot upstream and downstream services and understand how minor issues may have larger repercussions, similar to service maps. Relationship types Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. Read relationships of an entity You can use the NerdGraph relationship API to read the existing relationship of your monitored entities. The following example shows how to query an entity by its specific GUID, using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer.

      "body": "This document provides examples of how to use New Relic NerdGraph to query and modify your cloud integration configuration data, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can also query NRQL data. These examples for querying cloud integration configuration data use GraphQL queries and mutations: Queries: requests that are intended to only fetch data Mutations: requests that create or update data on the server Requirements Before querying cloud integration data with NerdGraph, ensure you have: Followed the instructions to connect cloud integrations with New Relic. Created an API key. Access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer To access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: Go to https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Add any of the following examples. Query examples Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). Queries in NerdGraph are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Available provider accounts This query returns a list of all provider accounts available in your infrastructure data. Depending on the provider, additional properties can be requested. For example, for GCP, you can also ask for the serviceAccountId property, which is needed when linking a new GCP project to New Relic. Anonymous: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug ... on CloudGcpProvider { serviceAccountId } } } } } } Named: query cloudProviders { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } } } } } Specific provider account information This query returns information about a specific provider account for your Amazon AWS integration. The properties id, name, slug are requested, along with a list of integrations available to be monitored. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { id slug name services { id slug name } } } } } } Specific integration data from a specific cloud provider This query returns information about a specific cloud service integration of a provider. In this example, the integration is the Amazon AWS ALB monitoring integration and the provider is AWS. The properties id, name, slug, and isAllowed are requested with the available configuration parameters. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { service(slug: \"alb\") { id name slug isEnabled } } } } } } List of enabled cloud accounts This query returns the list of cloud accounts enabled with your New Relic account. (Your cloud account associates your New Relic account and a specific provider account with your integration.) You can enable multiple cloud provider accounts in the same New Relic account, even with the same cloud provider. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { id name createdAt provider { id name } } } } } } Specific linked account data This query returns information about a linked account, including the properties name, providerId, and a list of the cloud integrations enabled for monitoring. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integrations { id name createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Enabled cloud integrations for all linked accounts This query returns all monitored integrations for all the provider cloud accounts. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { name provider { id name } integrations { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Specific cloud integration data for a specific linked account This query returns information about a specific integration from a specific linked account. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integration(id: <INTEGRATION_ID>) { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Mutation examples Mutations are requests that are intended to have side effects, such as creating or updating data on the server. Mutations require the keyword mutation and the name of the mutation. NerdGraph mutations are restricted to a subset of all possible mutations. Link an account This mutation allows linking cloud provider accounts to a New Relic account, creating one or more linked accounts. It can link one specific cloud provider account (for example aws) to the New Relic account or multiple cloud provider accounts to one New Relic account. Required: The parameter <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME> is required and cannot be empty. It must be unique in your New Relic account. Other parameters are specific to the provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) and are also required. In the following sections, you can see which parameters are required for each provider account. After linking an account the createdAt and updatedAt values are equal. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accounts: { accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Link an Amazon AWS account This mutation links an Amazon AWS provider account to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Link a Microsoft Azure account This mutation links a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, applicationId: <azure_application_id>, clientSecret: <azure_application_key>, tenantId: <azure_tenant_id>, subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Link a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project This mutation links a GCP project to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, projectId: <GCP_PROJECT_ID> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Rename one or more cloud accounts This mutation allows you to rename one or more linked provider accounts. The name parameter is required, cannot be empty, and must be unique within your New Relic account. mutation { cloudRenameAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: [ { id: <linked_account_id_1>, name: <new_provider_account_name> }, { id: <linked_account_id_2>, name: <new_provider_account_name> } ] ) { linkedAccounts { id name } } } Enable an integration in a cloud account This mutation allows you to enable the monitoring of one or more specific cloud integrations in an existing cloud account. With this mutation, New Relic records data for the enabled integration from the provider account. For each provider account you have access to different input parameters, matching each available service. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, <other_parameters> }] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Enable an integration in multiple cloud accounts If you have many provider accounts linked, you can enable the same integration in the many cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug> : [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_2> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Enable multiple integrations in multiple cloud accounts If you have multiple cloud accounts linked, you can also enable multiple integrations in multiple linked cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug_1>: { <integration_slug_1>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_1> } ] <integration_slug_2>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_2> } ] }, <provider_slug_2>: { <integration_slug_3>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_3>}, { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_4>} ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Modify an integration's configuration (regions, polling intervals, etc.) This mutation also allows you to modify one or more cloud integrations and change one or more configuration parameters. Each service will have specific parameters that you can modify. For parameters of a type list (for example, awsRegion) supply the full list. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug>: { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: <new_polling_interval>, <parameter_1>: <value_1>, <parameter_N>: <value_N>, }] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval, <parameter_1>, <parameter_N> } } errors { type message } } } Disable (remove) an integration This mutation allows you to disable an integration and stop data collection for the specific cloud integration. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { : { : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id name authLabel provider { id } } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Unlink account This mutation allows you to unlink cloud provider accounts from New Relic account. This action can not be undone. However, you can link the account again, but account history will still be lost. mutation { cloudUnlinkAccount ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } } ) { unlinkedAccounts { id name } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Enable an Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To enable an Amazon AWS integration: Send query to fetch account data Send a query to fetch data about the account, specifically available providers and already created provider accounts: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } linkedAccounts { name integrations { id name } } } } } } Link AWS provider account Link an AWS provider account, if there is not one already linked or if you want to link another AWS account: Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter. Provide a name for the provider account in the <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>. Include the ARN of the AWS role used to fetch data from your AWS account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } errors { type message } } } Enable Amazon AWS SQS integration Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Enable integration in multiple provider accounts If you have multiple accounts with the same provider account, you can enable the same integration in multiple provider accounts at the same time. Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider accounts in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_n> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_2>, configuration_param_1: value_1, configuration_param_2: value_2 } ] } } }) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Change polling interval for Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To change the polling interval of an AWS integration: Update the polling interval To update the polling interval for an Amazon AWS SQS integration, use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the id of the linked provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value: mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws : { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: 300 } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval } } errors { type message } } } Disable Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To disable an AWS integration: Disable the SQS integration Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the linked cloud account the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id accountId name } errors { type message } } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimit: TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS }) { id name } } NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimit: TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS }) { id name baselineDirection } } NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimit: TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragmentsto request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. 1. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query sinceValue } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimit } } } } } } 2. Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimit } } } } } 3. Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Here'a an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Quickly tag a set of resources 5 min Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us # Set the profile as default newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Copy Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Note Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. # Adding a single tag newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value # Adding multiple tags newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands.

      "info": "Explore NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, and build the queries you need.",
      "body": "Explore NerdGraph using the API Explorer 25 min NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic API key. You can create one directly from the NerdGraph API Explorer. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. # curl version curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' # New Relic CLI version newrelic nerdgraph query '{ actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } ' Copy Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

      "info": "When sending trace data to New Relic's Trace API, you can decorate spans so that they display with specific properties and details in the UI.",
      "body": "This document will explain how to add attributes to trace data sent to the Trace API so that spans display specific properties in the UI. Why decorate your spans? When you send data to our Trace API, you can add custom attributes to spans. For example, you might decide to add attributes like customer.id or user.id in order to help you analyze your trace data. Some expected attribute values cause our distributed tracing UI to display some specific trace properties and details. For example, if a span has an attribute with an error. prefix, the UI displays that span with an error. For another example, a span with an attribute that has a db. prefix will be displayed as a datastore span in the UI, and will have its datastore query highlighted. Decorating your spans to show specific properties in our UI can help you: Better understand the structure of your trace data. More easily troubleshoot problems. How to decorate your spans with attributes This table explains how to get spans sent to the Trace API to show up with specific properties in the UI. For property descriptions, see span properties. Desired span property UI indicator How to add property Errors Use an attribute with an error. prefix. For example: error.message. External Use an attribute with an http. prefix. For example: http.method. A span will also appear as an external if it has a child that comes from a different entity. Datastore Use an attribute with an db. prefix. For example: db.statement. Service This cannot be done with an attribute. A span is classified as a service span if it's the root span, or if its parent is from a different entity. If a span has several properties, service span classification takes precedence in the UI. In-process This cannot be done with an attribute. A span is classified as in-process if it hasn't been classified as a service span, datastore span, or external span. For more on how these span properties are determined and stored, see Trace structure. Tips for adding attributes: You can add any attribute to a span. For example: you might add an attribute like customer.id so that you could search traces globally for traces containing a specific customer. A span can be in multiple categories. For example, external is a more general category than is datastore, so if a span is classified as both external and datastore, it will be indicated as a datastore span in the UI.

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 20 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. The following sections describe how to serve your app locally, add it to New Relic One, and then share it with coworkers. Serve it locally: During development, you can serve it locally to test it out. Publish it: When your application is ready for the world, you can publish and deploy it, and subscribe accounts to it. Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI The Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. About permissions The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators or owners have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to Nerdpacks available to that acount. You can learn about permissions related to managing applications in the product documentation. About versions New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published. Thus, the nr1 nerdpack:publish command requires the following: The Nerdpack manager role A unique version as specified in the version attribute found in the app's package.json. Step 1 of 4 Serve your app locally While developing your application, you can locally serve the Nerdpack, which will display it in New Relic One. In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Step 2 of 4 Publish Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 3 of 4 Deploy Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with many specific version numbers. To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Step 4 of 4 Subscribe You provide access to the Nerdpacks you create (or manage) by subscribing accounts to them. When you publish and deploy your application, it’s available to you in the New Relic One catalog. Use the catalog to manage the information that you want to share about your application, as well as how it appears on the Apps page. Subscribe accounts to your applications with the catalog too.

Permission for managing applications User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on: New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack Manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what the apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local (you made it!), custom, or public. Browser Analyzer app with browser app entity listed, plus duplicate clean up tab. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. When you create an application by running nr1 create, a generic icon.png file is added to your project. Replace this with an icon of your choice, but keep the file name icon.png to update your application's icon in the catalog. 1. Update the New Relic One CLI Make sure you have the latest version of the New Relic One CLI by running nr1 update. 2. Add catalog metadata and screenshots Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following table for the process to succeed. File Requirements screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads & entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n-Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n-Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n-Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n-Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } 3. Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog Run nr1 catalog:submit. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. Subscribe accounts to an application Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: - Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. - Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the Public apps created by New Relic. - Click the update button. Now you and the accounts you subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Unsubscribe to an application On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Other apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Remove duplicates In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.

      "body": "Original user model This doc contains information about how to manage users on our original user model. Not sure which pricing plan or user model you're on? See Overview of pricing plan and user models. View and manage users To see the users on your New Relic account and their current roles: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. User types: basic user and full user On the Users and roles UI page, users are categorized as either full users or basic users. This only affects your account if you've switched to the New Relic One pricing plan, released July 2020. Once you've changed your pricing plan, the number of full users is a factor in your billing. To learn more, see Transition to new pricing. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. The Owner can also install and configure the New Relic agent, and they can enable or set up features. Admins One or more individuals who can add, edit, and delete account users. Admins can also install and configure the New Relic agent, and they can enable or set up features. Users One or more individuals who use (and optionally set up) the available New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted Users One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select plus-circle New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select pencil Edit role or trash-o Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. fa-check Change the account Owner. fa-check Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. fa-check fa-check Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check fa-check fa-check Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check fa-check fa-check Manage flexible data retention. fa-check Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One fa-check fa-check Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts.

      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the entity explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name label) and \"test\" (environment label). APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful categories. How to do it Read the overview: Use tags to organize and group what you monitor. Follow these instructions for creating tags: NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, apps monitored by New Relic APM or New Relic Browser, hosts monitored by New Relic Infrastructure, and so on) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.

Tags are used to organize and group all your entities in a way that's useful for troubleshooting and understanding your environment. To add, delete, or modify your tags, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. NerdGraph allows you to tag your entities with a key and an associated list of values. You can also use NerdGraph to query entities. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace all the existing values for a tag with new ones: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

You can display the metrics you collect in a variety of value methods, including throughput, averages, min/max, and rate. The metrics appear in charts and tables you create for your plugin's user interface. Use integers and floats Because New Relic Plugins is designed to report on frequency metrics, all metric data should be non-negative integers or floating-point numbers: Non-negative integers: Supported. Floating-point numbers: Supported. Negative values: Not supported, except for summary metrics on the plugin's Summary page. Otherwise, the UI shows negative values as zero. String values: Not supported; the UI shows strings as zero. However, parts of your metric name (the key) can be displayed in the UI. Define the time period (duration) All metrics must include a duration period that starts no more than a few hours in the past. The end time is set automatically to the time New Relic Plugins receives the metrics. You cannot report a duration that starts or ends in the future, or a duration that ends in the past. For best results, use one of the plugin SDKs to create your plugin. Otherwise, some POST attempts may fail because the actual recorded duration could vary in increments of the plugin's scheduled reporting frequency. Follow unit conversion guidelines Plugins automatically converts some units (such as rate units) to more natural forms. For example, [bytes/second] is converted to Bps. Follow these guidelines for unit conversions: Long format: Always specify the long format (for example, [bytes/second]) in the metric name. The long or short version will be used as appropriate. (Unit designations are not case sensitive.) Consistency: Use modifiers consistently in the metric name. If you use a different modifier with the same metric name, it will be treated as a different metric. Optional: Standard modifiers: Provide standard modifiers to the first metric in a value unit. For example, rather than specifying [bytes/second], you can specify [kiloBytes/second]. Plugins accepts these standard modifiers: Modifier Multiplier Modifier Multiplier Kilo 1000 --- --- Mega 1000^2 --- --- Giga 1000^3 Gibi 1024^3 Tera 1000^4 Tebi 1024^4 Peta 1000^5 Pebi 1024^5 Select value methods for display in the UI When you define a metric value for reporting, Plugins also captures a count, min, max, and sum of squares. Depending on whether you report single or aggregate values, you may report these numbers directly, or Plugins may calculate them automatically. You can then choose a value method for rendering these metrics in your plugin UI. In general, to configure value methods in the user interface: Select the metric you want to use. Review the list of value methods to select how to present the data in a column or plotted in a chart. Available value methods depend on the format of the units part of the metric name: Value method Count | Value Value Rate Count: The total of the count field over the entire timeslice data interval. When aggregating timeslice data, the count is summed. [check icon] [check icon] Total value: The total value over the entire time slice data interval. When aggregating timeslice data, the value field is summed [check icon] [check icon] Time rates only Average value: The total value divided by the total count, calculated only when units for both count and value are available. [check icon] [check icon] [check icon] Throughput: The total count divided by the time interval of the time slice. By default New Relic Plugins measures the throughput in minutes according to the count units, such as calls per minute or bytes per minute. When the count units are specified in time (seconds), then the throughput appears as a percentage. [check icon] Min/Max: The statistical values for minimum and maximum values when recorded in the metric value along with Count and Value. [check icon] [check icon] [check icon] Standard deviation: The standard deviation of the entire set of measures recorded over the time interval. This is available only if the sum of squares field was populated in the metric value. The sum of squares and mean are used to calculate the standard deviation. In practice, this is meaningful only for populations that resemble a normal distribution. [check icon] [check icon] [check icon] Rate: The rate is the total value divided by the time interval. When units of the value are in time, then the rate value is a percentage value. Units that are themselves rates will not have an explicit rate value method. The rate is simply the average value. [check icon] Percentage: If you want the metric to appear as a percentage in the user interface, then you must define it as a percentage in the JSON.

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.

      "body": "Developers are creating new and innovative apps that extend and enhance your data views. From New Relic One's apps page, you can subscribe to apps you create, publish, and deploy, as well as those created by New Relic engineers and other organizations. You can also launch the apps you subscribe to. Just select Apps from the New Relic One home page to see what's available. one.newrelic.com > Apps: Under the New Relic One catalog section, you can subscribe to applications. Create and share open source apps The Other apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide information we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Other apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. If you’ve started to develop applications on the New Relic One platform, you probably want to share them with your broader organization. That’s where the catalog comes in. When you publish and deploy your app, it’s available to you in the catalog. You can manage the information that you want to share about your application, as well as how it appears on the New Relic One app page. You can also subscribe accounts to it. Permission for managing applications User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on: New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack Manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what the apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local (you made it!), custom, or public. Browser Analyzer app with browser app entity listed, plus duplicate clean up tab. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. When you create an application by running nr1 create, a generic icon.png file is added to your project. Replace this with an icon of your choice, but keep the file name icon.png to update your application's icon in the catalog. 1. Update the New Relic One CLI Make sure you have the latest version of the New Relic One CLI by running nr1 update. 2. Add catalog metadata and screenshots Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following table for the process to succeed. File Requirements screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads & entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n-Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n-Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n-Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n-Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } 3. Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog Run nr1 catalog:submit. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. Subscribe accounts to an application Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: - Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. - Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the Public apps created by New Relic. - Click the update button. Now you and the accounts you subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Unsubscribe to an application On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Other apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Remove duplicates In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.

Adding agent data to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in New Relic One. This document explains how to add agent data to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. For example, to deploy with native support for a Flask/Django app: Follow standard procedures to install the Python agent, including your license key. Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE as an environment variable pointing to newrelic.ini. Once the agent and configuration file have been installed, the Python agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Overview page. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add agent data to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Our GAE flex examples on Github for Python Google App Engine's documentation for Python Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Python app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies When building a custom runtime using Docker, set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE as an environment variable pointing to the Dockerfile instead of to your Python app's newrelic.ini. Follow standard procedures to install the Python agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures Python to create a Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK also provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example shows the Python agent installed for an application served with gunicorn. These procedures are similar to the Python quick start guide. The Dockerfile will contain customer-specific code, including Python version, installation requirements, etc). # [START dockerfile] FROM gcr.io/google_appengine/python # Install the fortunes binary from the debian repositories. RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y fortunes # Optional: Change the -p argument to use Python 2.7. RUN virtualenv /env -p python3.5 # Set virtualenv environment variables. This is equivalent to running # source /env/bin/activate. ENV VIRTUAL_ENV /env ENV PATH /env/bin:$PATH ADD requirements.txt /app/ RUN pip install -r requirements.txt ADD . /app/ CMD NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app # [END dockerfile] 4. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse To view your GAE flex app data, go to the APM Overview page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect Python agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, add the following statement to the newrelic.ini configuration: log_file = stderr To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.

      "body": "Create a \"Hello, World!\" application 15 min Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the NR1 VS Code extension to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: npm start Copy Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: nr1 nerdpack:publish Copy Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: nr1 create Copy Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: nr1 catalog:submit Copy Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it. Related information Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can see it directly on their homepage.",

      "body": "Developers are creating new and innovative apps that extend and enhance your data views. From New Relic One's apps page, you can subscribe to apps you create, publish, and deploy, as well as those created by New Relic engineers and other organizations. You can also launch the apps you subscribe to. Just select Apps from the New Relic One home page to see what's available. one.newrelic.com > Apps: Under the New Relic One catalog section, you can subscribe to applications. Create and share open source apps The Other apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide information we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Other apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. If you’ve started to develop applications on the New Relic One platform, you probably want to share them with your broader organization. That’s where the catalog comes in. When you publish and deploy your app, it’s available to you in the catalog. You can manage the information that you want to share about your application, as well as how it appears on the New Relic One app page. You can also subscribe accounts to it. Permission for managing applications User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on: New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack Manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what the apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local (you made it!), custom, or public. Browser Analyzer app with browser app entity listed, plus duplicate clean up tab. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. When you create an application by running nr1 create, a generic icon.png file is added to your project. Replace this with an icon of your choice, but keep the file name icon.png to update your application's icon in the catalog. 1. Update the New Relic One CLI Make sure you have the latest version of the New Relic One CLI by running nr1 update. 2. Add catalog metadata and screenshots Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following table for the process to succeed. File Requirements screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads & entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n-Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n-Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n-Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n-Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } 3. Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog Run nr1 catalog:submit. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. Subscribe accounts to an application Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: - Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. - Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the Public apps created by New Relic. - Click the update button. Now you and the accounts you subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Unsubscribe to an application On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Other apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Remove duplicates In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.

      "info": "Explore NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, and build the queries you need.",
      "body": "Explore NerdGraph using the API Explorer 25 min NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic API key. You can create one directly from the NerdGraph API Explorer. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. # curl version curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' # New Relic CLI version newrelic nerdgraph query '{ actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } ' Copy Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from `nr1`; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

(Infinite Tracing) Find or create a trace observer endpoint This section only applies to Infinite Tracing. If you are enabling standard distributed tracing, continue to Configure the agents. Infinite Tracing collects your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. Agents send all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. You can use GraphQL to see if someone has already created a trace observer endpoint for your account. If you can't find one, you need to create a new endpoint. Complete the following trace observer steps in order: 2a. Open NerdGraph API explorer Prepare to execute some GraphQL: Open NerdGraph API explorer. In the API key dropdown next to Tools, select your personal API key for your account under one of these options: Select an existing API key Create a new API key 2b. See if anyone in your organization has already created a trace observer endpoint The following steps show you how to execute a GraphQL query to find out if you can use an existing trace observer in your AWS region. If one isn't available, then you can go to Step 2c. Create a new one. Copy the following query into the middle pane of the NerdGraph API explorer and replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID with your account ID (the number next to your account name in NerdGraph API explorer): { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { edge { tracing { traceObservers { errors { message type } traceObservers { endpoints { agent { host port } endpointType https { host port url } status } id name providerRegion } } } } } } } Click the triangle button to execute the query, or press Ctrl+Enter. Check the right pane showing the results: In traceObservers, if you see an AWS region (providerRegion) appropriate for your location, copy its associated endpoint values. Here's an example of what to copy: (Required)agent: host (Save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST in Step 3. Configure the agents) (Optional)https: url (Save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL in Step 2d. Send test data to the trace observer) If you don't see any results in traceObservers as shown in the following example, continue to 2c. Create a new one. 2c. If you don't find an existing trace observer endpoint, create a new one If you didn't find a trace observer endpoint after running the query in the previous section, you need to create one. To do this, execute a GraphQL mutation that passes your configuration details. Copy the following into the middle pane of the NerdGraph API explorer. mutation { edgeCreateTraceObserver(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, traceObserverConfigs: {name: \"YOUR_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME\", providerRegion: YOUR_PROVIDER_REGION}) { responses { errors { message type } traceObserver { endpoints { agent { host port } endpointType https { host port url } status } id name providerRegion } } } } Insert your own values into the mutation: Value Description YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID Replace this with your account ID (the number next to your account name in NerdGraph API explorer). YOUR_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME Replace this with a name that describes the services that report to this trace observer (for example, production or query services). YOUR_PROVIDER_REGION Replace this with the provider region enum value for your location: AWS_EU_WEST_1 AWS_US_EAST_1 AWS_US_WEST_2 Click the triangle button to execute the mutation, or press Ctrl+Enter. In the right pane showing the results, copy the following endpoints to a text file so you can use them later: (Required) agent: host (Save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST in Step 3. Configure the agents) (Optional) https: url (Save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL in 2d. Send test data to the trace observer) 2d. (Optional) Send test data to the trace observer This optional test includes a sample payload with one trace and two spans from the same service: Test Service A. Follow these steps to send a test request: Get or generate your Insert API key so you can use it later in the configuration (Note that the Insert API key is not your license). Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl request curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.test.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ 'YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY Replace this with your Insert API key (not your New Relic license key). YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the value under https: url from the previous step. Copy the content of the text editor into a terminal and execute the request. If the test does not return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted indicating success, check the following and try again: Confirm that you substituted the url (not host) value for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Confirm that you only have single quotes around the value you inserted for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you are using the Insert API key (not a license key). If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to New Relic One to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Step 3. Configure the agents Distributed tracing is enabled through configuration settings. The settings you need to change for distributed tracing depend on the type you want: Standard distributed tracing Infinite Tracing (requires YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST from step 2) Review the following section for your agent to see the required configuration settings.

View traces After you upgrade and configure your APM agents to send data to your trace observer, you are ready to view traces. Here are two alternatives: View traces that include a specific service The Entity explorer helps you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Entity explorer in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for Infinite Tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Apps in the top menu bar. Under Favorites click Distributed tracing. In the Find traces... search, type a search clause to find the service. For example, to query service.name or trace.id: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when createDistributedTracePayload() is called, an empty string is returned. To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.

      "body": "If you have telemetry data from Istio, Kamon, OpenCensus, and OpenTelemetry, you can view it in the New Relic UI by sending it through one of our telemetry integrations. To integrate your AWS X-Ray telemetry data, use the infrastructure integration. Since distributed systems can generate a lot of trace data, telemetry tools rely on data sampling (filtering) to find useful data. Our telemetry integrations offer you two sampling options: Use your tool’s native sampling (default): The default installation assumes you are relying on your telemetry tool to sample the data before the integration passes the data to our Trace API. Even though your tool may be sampling data, our Trace API may randomly sample out traces that exceed your rate limit. Use Infinite Tracing (limited release): This approach assumes you turn off sampling in your telemetry tool and then send all your data to a New Relic trace observer in AWS. The trace observer selects the most important and actionable traces using tail-based sampling and then sends your traces to our Trace API. To use this approach, complete the default installation but then configure a new endpoint for a trace observer. To start using Infinite Tracing, please go to our sign-up page. Here's an overview of the steps to enable distributed tracing: Install the integration (Infinite Tracing) Provision a trace observer on New Relic Edge (Infinite Tracing) Configure your open source integration View your traces in New Relic One Step 1. Install the integration If you haven't already installed one of these integrations in your services, follow the link for your integration and complete the installation. After the installation, if you are not enabling Infinite Tracing, skip to Step 4. View traces in New Relic One. Istio adapter Kamon reporter OpenCensus Go language exporter Python language exporter OpenTelemetry Go language exporter Java language exporter .NET language exporter Step 2. (Infinite Tracing) Find or create a trace observer endpoint Infinite Tracing collects your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. Integrations send all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. You can use GraphQL to see if someone has already created a trace observer endpoint for your account. If you can't find one, you need to create a new endpoint. Complete the following trace observer steps: 2a. Open NerdGraph API explorer Prepare to execute some GraphQL: Open NerdGraph API explorer. In the API key dropdown next to Tools, select your personal API key for your account under one of these options: Select an existing API Key Create a new API Key 2b. See if anyone in your organization has already created a trace observer endpoint The following steps show you how to execute a GraphQL query to find out if you can use an existing trace observer in your AWS region. If one isn't available, you can go to Step 2c. Create a new one. Copy the following query into the middle pane of the NerdGraph API explorer and replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID with your account ID (the number next to your account name in NerdGraph API explorer): { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { edge { tracing { traceObservers { errors { message type } traceObservers { endpoints { agent { host port } endpointType https { host port url } status } id name providerRegion } } } } } } } Click the triangle button to execute the query or press Ctrl+Enter. Check the right pane showing the results: In traceObservers, if you see an AWS region (providerRegion) appropriate for your location, copy its associated endpoint values. Here's an example of what to copy: (Required) https: host (save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST in Configure the integration) (Required)https: port (save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT in Configure the integration) (Optional) https: url (save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL in Send test data to the trace observer) If you don't see any values in traceObservers as shown below, continue to Step 2c. Create a new one. 2c. If you can't find an existing trace observer endpoint, create a new one If you didn't find a trace observer after running the query in the previous section, you need to create one. To do this, you execute a GraphQL mutation that passes your configuration details. Copy the following into the middle pane of the NerdGraph API explorer. mutation { edgeCreateTraceObserver(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, traceObserverConfigs: {name: \"YOUR_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME\", providerRegion: YOUR_PROVIDER_REGION}) { responses { errors { message type } traceObserver { endpoints { agent { host port } endpointType https { host port url } status } id name providerRegion } } } } Insert your own values into the mutation: Value Description YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID Replace this with your account ID (the number next to your account name in NerdGraph API explorer). YOUR_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME Replace this with a name that describes the services that report to this trace observer (for example, production or query services). YOUR_PROVIDER_REGION Replace this with the provider region enum value for your location: AWS_EU_WEST_1 AWS_US_EAST_1 AWS_US_WEST_2 Click the triangle button to execute the mutation or press Ctrl+Enter. In the right pane showing the results, copy the following endpoint values to a text file so you can use them later: (Required) https: host (save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST in Configure the integration) (Required)https: port (save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT in Configure the integration) (Optional) https: url (save to use later as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL in Send test data to the trace observer) 2d. (Optional) Send test data to the trace observer This test includes a sample payload with one trace and two spans from the same service: Test Service A. Follow these steps to send a test request: Get or generate your Insert API key so you can use it later in the test. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl request curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.test.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ 'YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY Replace this with your Insert API key (not the same as your personal API key for NerdGraph API explorer) YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the value under https: url from above. Copy the content of the text editor into a terminal, and then execute the request. If the test does not return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted indicating success, check the following and try again: Confirm that you substituted the url (not host) value for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Confirm that you only have single quotes around the value you inserted for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you are using the Insert API Key (not a license). If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to New Relic One to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Step 3. (Infinite Tracing) Configure the integration To enable Infinite Tracing, configure your integration to send the telemetry data to the trace observer by using the results from Step 2. Find or create a trace observer endpoint. Find the section below describing these steps for your integration: Istio adapter Set the spansHost value with YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL when deploying the Helm chart. Kamon reporter Set the span-ingest-uri value with YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL in your kamon.newrelic configuration block. OpenCensus (Go language exporter) Set the SpansURLOverride field on the Config object with YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL when creating the Exporter. OpenCensus (Python language exporter) Pass the host and port parameters to the Trace Exporter using YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST and YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT. OpenTelemetry (Go language exporter) Set the SpansURLOverride field on the Config object with YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL when creating the Exporter. OpenTelemetry (Java language exporter) Complete the following: Create a java.net.URI with YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Pass the URI to com.newrelic.telemetry.opentelemetry.export.NewRelicSpanExporter builder’s uriOverride method. See an example where a NewRelicSpanExporter is created. OpenTelemetry (.NET language exporter) Configure the TraceUrlOverride parameter with YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Step 4. View traces After you configure your integration to send data to New Relic, you are ready to view traces.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from `nr1`; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

When you publish and deploy your app, it’s available to you in the catalog. You can manage the information that you want to share about your application, as well as how it appears on the New Relic One app page. You can also subscribe accounts to it. Permission for managing applications User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on: New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack Manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what the apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local (you made it!), custom, or public. Browser Analyzer app with browser app entity listed, plus duplicate clean up tab. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. When you create an application by running nr1 create, a generic icon.png file is added to your project. Replace this with an icon of your choice, but keep the file name icon.png to update your application's icon in the catalog. 1. Update the New Relic One CLI Make sure you have the latest version of the New Relic One CLI by running nr1 update. 2. Add catalog metadata and screenshots Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following table for the process to succeed. File Requirements screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads & entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n-Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n-Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n-Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n-Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } 3. Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog Run nr1 catalog:submit. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. Subscribe accounts to an application Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: - Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. - Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the Public apps created by New Relic. - Click the update button. Now you and the accounts you subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Unsubscribe to an application On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Other apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Remove duplicates In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Create a \"Hello, World!\" application 15 min Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the NR1 VS Code extension to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: npm start Copy Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: nr1 nerdpack:publish Copy Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: nr1 create Copy Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: nr1 catalog:submit Copy Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it. Related information Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from `nr1`; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

      "body": "You can create alert conditions using NRQL queries. Create NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL condition: When you start to create a condition, where it prompts you to Select a product, click NRQL. Tips on creating a NRQL condition: NRQL conditions Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For some condition types, you can create a Description. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Configure whether and how open violations are force-closed. Adjust the evaluation offset. Create a concise and descriptive condition name. (NerdGraph API Only) Provide a text description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Troubleshooting procedures Optional: To include your organization's procedures for handling the incident, add the runbook URL to the condition. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Offset the query time window Every minute, we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows. The start time depends on the value you select in the NRQL condition's Advanced settings > Evaluation offset. Example: Using the default time window to evaluate violations With the Evaluation offset at the default setting of three minutes, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend evaluating data from three minutes ago or longer. An offset of less than 3 minutes will trigger violations sooner, but you might see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Create a description You can define a description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by downstream systems.

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This document will introduce you to what NRQL is, why you'd use it, and basic syntax rules. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results New Relic Insights NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in both New Relic One and New Relic Insights. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction New Relic Browser events, like PageView New Relic Mobile events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days:​ SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.

      "body": "Most data generated by integrations is available in New Relic One dashboards, where you can query your data using NRQL and build custom dashboards. The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK. For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see Understand integration data. Get started with integration data Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic: From the one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries. Use the data explorer or the dashboards to explore and understand the available data. Read the documentation for a specific integration to learn about the reported data. When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your Insights dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric over the past day, faceted by displayName: select average('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') from BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' AND providerAccountId = '72' facet displayName TIMESERIES SINCE 1 day ago Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by name: SELECT average(activeMessages) from AzureServiceBusTopicSample TIMESERIES 5 minutes since 6 hours ago FACET displayName Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours: SELECT sum('functionExecutionCount.Total') FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample WHERE providerAccountId = '125' SINCE 6 hour ago TIMESERIES auto FACET displayName Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT count(*) FROM AzureVirtualMachineSample SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO WHERE provider = 'AzureVirtualMachine' TIMESERIES NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average('requestsPerSecond') as 'Requests' FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES until 1 minutes ago For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing active MySQL connections over time: SELECT average('connectionsActive') as 'Active Connections' FROM MysqlSample TIMESERIES until 1 minutes ago For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) from InfrastructureEvent where format='inventoryChange' facet changeType since 1 day ago You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Integration event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

      "body": "As software systems grow more complex, the teams building the next generation of websites, apps, and services need tools that can provide end-to-end visibility across the entire stack. New Relic provides these tools—offering the features (such as sub-second query responses on real-time data, dashboards with powerful charting, and flexible alerts) that are essential to building great products. Bundled into all New Relic solutions, Insights enables users to unlock the full power of the un-aggregated, highly dimensional event data collected by New Relic agents. By applying the tips and best practices detailed here, you can use New Relic Insights to build better performance into your systems with every release. We have an improved way to query and create custom charts: New Relic One. For tips on switching from Insights to New Relic One, see this transition guide. 1. Explore your data The Insights data explorer offers rich, full-text search across thousands of events and metrics collected by New Relic agents on your applications and hosts. Use it to explore and chart not just the default available data types but also any custom events and metrics you’ve added. For example, if you were to use custom metrics to track messages sent and received on a Kafka queue, you could easily find and add those metrics to a dashboard alongside error rate or throughput trends. From within the metric explorer, you can change the scope of metrics using wildcards, facet your metrics by application host, and expose an API call for the metric via a single click. How to do it (Event explorer) Here's how to use the Insights event data explorer: Go to insights.newrelic.com and select Data explorer > Events. Select a data type to explore. Review the attribute names and values shown for the data matching your view. Select attributes to group by and plot. On the NRQL-generated query, click Run. Configure the chart options as needed. To add individual charts to a dashboard: Give the chart a meaningful title to identify it in a dashboard. Select Add to a dashboard. How to do it (Metric explorer) Here's how to use the Insights metric data explorer: Go to insights.newrelic.com and select Data explorer > Metrics. Select the entity or application your metrics report under. (To select a metric for your chart, browse the top metrics or search for a metric name.) View metric charts as you select them. Configure the chart options. Optional: To visit the API Explorer (which is preset to the selected metric and time range), select Explore API. To add individual charts to a dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Give each chart a meaningful title to identify it on the target dashboard. Data explorer example. 2. Try out NRQL queries Once you’ve explored some of the taxonomy of your data via data explorer, it’s time to start asking some direct questions of your data. You can do this via NRQL: a query language for making calls against our database. If you know SQL, you will already be familiar with a lot of NRQL syntax. And if you don’t know SQL, no worries: We’ll use example queries to get you up and running quickly. At its core, NRQL enables you to query data collected from your application and transform it into dynamic charts. You can then use that data to better understand how your application is used. For example, during incident response, you can test multiple hypotheses by asking and answering multiple questions in rapid succession—down to the individual user or end point (thanks to the un-aggregated, highly dimensional nature of New Relic data). How to do it Use the command-line query tool that appears at the top of your dashboards and on the Query history page to build commands with SQL-style syntax. As you type, the auto-completion feature suggests attributes and flags syntax errors with a red underline. (For more information about NRQL syntax, see Introduction to NRQL and NRQL reference. Here are some example NRQL queries to show you the art of the possible: Out-of-the-box performance: What is the distribution of response times for my app? SELECT histogram(duration, width: 2, buckets: 20) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = YOUR_APP_NAME SINCE 1 day ago What percent of time is spent in the application processing the request (outside of database processing)? SELECT (1-(average(duration)-average(databaseDuration))/average(duration))*100 AS '% of time in DB' FROM Transaction FACET name WHERE appName = YOUR_APP_NAME Lightweight custom instrumentation to drill down to an individual user: SELECT count(*) FROM MobileCrash WHERE `authentication_email` = ‘exampleuser@newrelic.com' Authentication_email is a custom attribute that’s been added to the default MobileCrash event type with a single line of code. (Find out more here.) See more examples: Try out the tutorials on your Insights homepage. If you’re using the New Relic Mobile agent, try out these examples. 3. Pin charts from other New Relic products Now that you’ve explored your data and asked some questions, it’s time to learn how Insights can be integrated with charts from other New Relic products. Using the add-to-Insights feature, you can pin any New Relic chart to an Insights dashboard. How to do it Mouse over the chart. Click the Add to an Insights Dashboard button. From the Copy chart dialog box: Select Copy to an existing dashboard (default) or Copy to a new dashboard. Edit the chart name as needed (maximum length: 255 characters). Click Copy. (Note: You can switch accounts from this dialog box to copy to different dashboards across accounts. You can also click the dashboard name in the green success bar to go the dashboard to which you added the chart.) Copy chart dialog box. 4. Create dashboard notes To make your dashboard more usable across your entire organization, use the dashboard notes feature to add context to any dashboard. Have a chart you’d like to describe for others? Have important links that go hand-in-hand with the dashboard (for example a runbook)? Dashboard notes allow you to add arbitrary text and images to your dashboard. Add notes to dashboards to record or share custom information about the dashboard. Because these notes use markdown syntax, it is easy to add elements such as headings, images, links, and so on. How to do it At the top of the dashboard, select Add Dashboard note. 5. Designate dashboards as favorites Get fast access to key dashboards by designating them as favorites. How to do it: To make a dashboard a favorite, click the star icon. (Favorite dashboards appear at the top of the dashboards list.) To remove a dashboard from your favorites, click the star icon again. 5. Apply a filter to a dashboard You can easily drill down into specifics about your data in Insights. All you have to do to change the data presented is input text into a search box. For example, anyone can visit a dashboard and input a user's email address to access data un-aggregated for that user. How to do it: On the dashboard, select Edit. Then select Filter disabled or click the gear icon. Select Enable filter. From the Event types drop-down menu, select one or more data types. From the Select attribute drop-down menu, select one or more attributes to restrict filtering to specific attributes. Select Filter enabled or click the blue gear icon again to close the Filter menu. To save your changes to the dashboard, select Done editing. Drill down to important data facets with ease by going to insights.newrelic.com > (selected dashboard) > Edit: Enable filtering on a dashboard. 6. Build a data app Do you want to present a bunch of dashboards as a whole? Are you thinking about sharing information beyond your DevOps teams? Data apps can help you do so. Designed to let users create self-service analytics reports that even non-technical users can employ to answer questions about performance, customers, feature usage, and more, data apps let business users click through preset drill-downs and modify their filters in real time via basic searches. As collections of linked dashboards that create curated, application-like experiences, data apps work on any attributes available in Insights. How to do it: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data apps > Create a data app. Specify an Icon, Title, URL, Description, and Permissions for your app. Select Create to save your new data app. After creating your data app, Insights automatically redirects you to a new dashboard. You can add widgets to this dashboard using standard NRQL queries. You can also create additional dashboards by selecting + Add from the data app navigation bar, or by copying an existing dashboard into your data app: From your data app dashboard, select Edit, then select Configure data app. From the Copy dropdown menu, choose a dashboard. (Dashboard copies are independent of the original dashboard—meaning changes to the original dashboard do not affect the copy, and editing or deleting the copied dashboard does not affect the original.) Learn more about data apps. 7. Link facets across dashboards within a data app Facet linking is a powerful way to build dashboards to tell a deep story around specific filters. For example, you can use the FACET clause in NRQL to break out your data by any string attribute. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (the default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. By using FACET linking, a user can jump to details of an individual company on a prebuilt dashboard showing specifics for that company. How to do it: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Data apps > (select a data app). Select the dashboard containing the widget you want to link from; then select Edit. From the widget you want to link, select the link fa-link icon. Select the target dashboard from the list. 8. Add a custom attribute and/or event via a New Relic agent All New Relic agents report some event data by default, out of the box. For example, each time a Mobile event occurs, more than 35 attributes are added, providing a wealth of ways to slice and dice your data. This allows you to troubleshoot faster, understand better, and focus on creating value rather than putting out fires. Eventually, however, you will probably want to add custom attributes to your event data. For example: you might want to add a unique user ID attribute that will let you see performance data on an individual user. With just a few lines of code, you can add custom attributes to your event data to enhance your ability to dashboard and filter your data along with other methods depending on the language. Since the approach you use will be specific to the agent you’re employing, we’ve provided a couple of examples below. Please view the New Relic docs for specifics on the agent you’re using. How to do it (for Java via agent API; you can also use an XML approach) To collect custom attributes via API, call the relevant methods. For each method you want to record an attribute, call addCustomParameter. Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include the following code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId). How to do it (for Agent API via Java APM agent) Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); In the above example, the first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Simply add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10,000 events, use the following: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. 9. Add a custom event Insights end point You can also enhance the information you report about your applications and systems by creating a custom event—via either a New Relic agent API or the Event API. If you chose the latter, you can send information from your system without adding a New Relic agent to it. You get all the benefits of our agent’s deep instrumentation in other parts of your stack in places where we don’t have an agent or you don’t want to add one. Keep in mind that Insights only supports event insertion via POST. Follow the instructions below to start reporting a new event type. How to do it: Go to the Manage data section of Insights. Click the API Keys tab. Register an Event API Insert key. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit the JSON to the Insights HTTPS end point using cURL in a POST request.
