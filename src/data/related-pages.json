      "body": "Get started with the New Relic CLI 20 min Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal: you can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. Our CLI has been designed for automating common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic personal API Key, which you can create from the Account settings of your New Relic account An instrumented application in your New Relic account Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI The New Relic CLI can be downloaded via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile Now that you've installed the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Note that you need to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY -r YOUR_REGION # Set the profile as defaults newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 10 Get your application details In this example, you are going to add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 The New Relic CLI can retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application use the apm application search command. If you get an error, check that the account ID and application name you provided are correct. newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Copy Step 5 of 10 If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example. When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. [ { accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, applicationId: YOUR_APP_ID, domain: 'APM', entityType: 'APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY', guid: 'A_LONG_GUID', name: 'NAME_OF_YOUR_APP', permalink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID', reporting: true, type: 'APPLICATION', }, ]; Copy Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Let's suppose that you want to add an environment tag to your application. Go ahead and add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Copy Step 7 of 10 What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets come to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags at once to your application, modify and run the following snippet. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 You've created and added some tags to your application, but how do you know they're there? You need to retrieve your application's tags. To retrieve your application's tags, use the entity tags get command. newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: Create a deployment marker Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same Application ID from your earlier search. newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Copy Step 10 of 10 Notice that the JSON response includes the revision and timestamp of the deployment. This workflow could be built into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to help indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here is an example. { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Set up New Relic using the Kubernetes operator 20 min Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. You can use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic entities. In this guide you'll learn how to set up New Relic for the first time with the official New Relic Kubernetes operator. More specifically, you'll provision an alert policy with NRQL conditions in your New Relic account using Kubernetes. Before you begin This walkthrough assumes you’ve already deployed a Kubernetes cluster. You could even create a local cluster on your machine with kind. To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Kubernetes. To complete the full exercise, you’ll need to: Deploy a New Relic agent if you haven't done so yet. Install New Relic for your application. Install kubectl and point it at the correct cluster; this determines the cluster where you’ll install the New Relic operator. Install kustomize. Step 1 of 3 Installing the operator on your Kubernetes cluster First, install cert-manager, which automatically provisions and manages TLS certificates in Kubernetes. kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.15.0/cert-manager.yaml Copy Next, install the Kubernetes operator. kustomize build https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-kubernetes-operator/config/default | kubectl apply -f - Copy To confirm the installation was successful, run a few kubectl commands to check the status of the Kubernetes operator. Ensure the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system, has been applied: kubectl get namespaces Copy The output should be similar to the following, which includes the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system: NAME STATUS AGE cert-manager Active 4m35s default Active 20m kube-node-lease Active 20m kube-public Active 20m kube-system Active 20m newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system Active 3m48s Copy Now, make sure the Kubernetes operator's controller manager is running: Note: Don't forget to include the --namespace (shorthand -n) option when running kubectl get pods to ensure you're inspecting resources within the correct namespace. kubectl get pods --namespace newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system Copy You should see output similar to the following: NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-7b9c64f58crwg9j 2/2 Running 0 157m Copy If your output is similar to the example shown, you’re ready for the next step. If you don’t see a pod named newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-<hash>, double check your Kubernetes configuration to ensure you’re within the correct context and pointing to the correct cluster. Step 2 of 3 Creating your first alert policy To kick things off, start small. First, create an alert policy with the minimum required configuration, then add a NRQL alert condition to the policy, which will add the condition to the policy in New Relic. A minimal alert policy configuration is represented in the code below. For the sake of this walkthrough, name this file new_relic_alert_policy.yaml. Note: For help locating your personal API key, check out New Relic's personal API key documentation. apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic personal API key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' Copy Now run the kubectl apply command to create your alert policy. kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml Copy You'll see output that reads similar to the following: alertspolicy.nr.k8s.newrelic.com/my-policy created Copy Confirm that your alert policy was created by viewing your policies at alerts.newrelic.com/accounts/{your account ID}/policies. You can search for your new policy by its name. In this case, search for \"Alert Policy Created With k8s.\" You should see your new alert policy. Next it’s time to add a NRQL alert condition to the policy using the same configuration file. Step 3 of 3 Add NRQL alert conditions to your alert policy In the previous section you created an alert policy; now, you’ll add some alert conditions to the policy so you can trigger alerts when certain metrics are out of line. In your new_relic_alert_policy.yaml file, add a NRQL alert condition to the policy that will alert you when an application's average overall response time is above five seconds for a three minute period. Note: To receive notifications when an alert is triggered, add notification channels to your alert policy, with this code. # The policy from the previous steps apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic personal API key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' # Add a NRQL alert condition to the policy conditions: - spec: type: 'NRQL' name: 'NRQL Alert Condition Created With k8s' nrql: query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'YOUR APP NAME'\" evaluationOffset: 3 enabled: true terms: - threshold: '5' threshold_occurrences: 'ALL' threshold_duration: 180 priority: 'CRITICAL' operator: 'ABOVE' violationTimeLimit: 'ONE_HOUR' valueFunction: 'SINGLE_VALUE' Copy With the alert condition added to the configuration, you can apply the update, which will create a NRQL alert condition and add it to your policy. kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml Copy To confirm that the NRQL alert condition was created successfully, refresh your alert policy. If you see a new alert condition added to the alert policy, it was a success. To finish things off, you'll create and add an alert channel to your alert policy. For example, maybe you want to send an email out to your team when your alert condition is triggered. Try it out now We have a Kubernetes test cluster ready for you in 2 minutes.

Note Some browsers automatically disable the use of iframes. If the module isn't loading please check your browser settings. Your browser does not support iframes. What’s next? Nice work — now you can manage your New Relic alert policies and NRQL alert conditions with code that integrates seamlessly within your Kubernetes workflow. This provides the ability to configure and manage your alerts with a domain-specific pattern, providing consistency and maintainability. You also gain the benefits of code reviews for any potential changes moving forward. As you and your team move forward, you might need to adjust some of the configuration values to better fit your needs. The New Relic Kubernetes Operator is just one of several tools in the New Relic Developer Toolkit aimed at facilitating observability as code.",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes four types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects which will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified.

Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms[threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms[operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined[value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms[threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms[operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined[metric]. It is compared with the terms[threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms[operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified.

      "body": "In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and alert conditions violations, and replacing these pages with a new synthetic monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. For more information, check the EoL Announcements page. If you want to receive alert notifications when a synthetic monitor fails, you can configure the alert notification either while creating a monitor or after you have created one. You can configure your monitor's alert policy directly from the Synthetics UI or via the Alerts UI for existing monitors. To identify which monitors do not have policies assigned to them, review their color-coded health status. Add a synthetic monitor to alert policies A monitor can be included in multiple alert policies. You can view the alert policies and conditions for the selected monitor from the Synthetics UI or from the Alerts UI. To add an existing monitor to an alert policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate one or more alert policies where the monitor has not already been added. Open the policy, then click Add a condition. Click Synthetics and then select the monitor. Fill out the remaining settings and click Create condition. Existing monitor: Remove from alert policy To remove an existing monitor from an existing alert policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate one or more alert policies where the monitor has not already been added. Select the trash can (delete) icon on the monitor's row. Receive alert notifications on a three-strike basis Synthetic alert notifications operate on a three-strike basis, sending an alert after three monitor attempts from a single location return an error. Your alert policy configuration and notification channel settings will determine when you receive alerts for specific monitors and locations. If you monitor a non-public app and add your selected public minion IPs to your allow list, you may very infrequently receive a false downtime alert. When a synthetic monitoring data center goes down, New Relic may decide to temporarily use an alternate host, which results in the temporary server's IP being blocked by your app. Mute (disable) monitor's alert notifications To temporarily disable alerting for a monitor, mute it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Monitors > (select a monitor). Click General under the Settings menu in the left menu sidebar. Click the Notifications button to Off. Muting a monitor's alert notifications will not mute multi-location alerts or NRQL alerts.

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User For your convenience, we automatically load all users and their email addresses for the selected account. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. A user channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. A device is registered if the user has logged into New Relic using the mobile app on the device. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.

      "body": "Set up New Relic using the Kubernetes operator 20 min Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. You can use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic entities. In this guide you'll learn how to set up New Relic for the first time with the official New Relic Kubernetes operator. More specifically, you'll provision an alert policy with NRQL conditions in your New Relic account using Kubernetes. Before you begin This walkthrough assumes you’ve already deployed a Kubernetes cluster. You could even create a local cluster on your machine with kind. To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Kubernetes. To complete the full exercise, you’ll need to: Deploy a New Relic agent if you haven't done so yet. Install New Relic for your application. Install kubectl and point it at the correct cluster; this determines the cluster where you’ll install the New Relic operator. Install kustomize. Step 1 of 3 Installing the operator on your Kubernetes cluster First, install cert-manager, which automatically provisions and manages TLS certificates in Kubernetes. kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.15.0/cert-manager.yaml Copy Next, install the Kubernetes operator. kustomize build https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-kubernetes-operator/config/default | kubectl apply -f - Copy To confirm the installation was successful, run a few kubectl commands to check the status of the Kubernetes operator. Ensure the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system, has been applied: kubectl get namespaces Copy The output should be similar to the following, which includes the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system: NAME STATUS AGE cert-manager Active 4m35s default Active 20m kube-node-lease Active 20m kube-public Active 20m kube-system Active 20m newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system Active 3m48s Copy Now, make sure the Kubernetes operator's controller manager is running: Note: Don't forget to include the --namespace (shorthand -n) option when running kubectl get pods to ensure you're inspecting resources within the correct namespace. kubectl get pods --namespace newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system Copy You should see output similar to the following: NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-7b9c64f58crwg9j 2/2 Running 0 157m Copy If your output is similar to the example shown, you’re ready for the next step. If you don’t see a pod named newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-<hash>, double check your Kubernetes configuration to ensure you’re within the correct context and pointing to the correct cluster. Step 2 of 3 Creating your first alert policy To kick things off, start small. First, create an alert policy with the minimum required configuration, then add a NRQL alert condition to the policy, which will add the condition to the policy in New Relic. A minimal alert policy configuration is represented in the code below. For the sake of this walkthrough, name this file new_relic_alert_policy.yaml. Note: For help locating your personal API key, check out New Relic's personal API key documentation. apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic personal API key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' Copy Now run the kubectl apply command to create your alert policy. kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml Copy You'll see output that reads similar to the following: alertspolicy.nr.k8s.newrelic.com/my-policy created Copy Confirm that your alert policy was created by viewing your policies at alerts.newrelic.com/accounts/{your account ID}/policies. You can search for your new policy by its name. In this case, search for \"Alert Policy Created With k8s.\" You should see your new alert policy. Next it’s time to add a NRQL alert condition to the policy using the same configuration file. Step 3 of 3 Add NRQL alert conditions to your alert policy In the previous section you created an alert policy; now, you’ll add some alert conditions to the policy so you can trigger alerts when certain metrics are out of line. In your new_relic_alert_policy.yaml file, add a NRQL alert condition to the policy that will alert you when an application's average overall response time is above five seconds for a three minute period. Note: To receive notifications when an alert is triggered, add notification channels to your alert policy, with this code. # The policy from the previous steps apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic personal API key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' # Add a NRQL alert condition to the policy conditions: - spec: type: 'NRQL' name: 'NRQL Alert Condition Created With k8s' nrql: query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'YOUR APP NAME'\" evaluationOffset: 3 enabled: true terms: - threshold: '5' threshold_occurrences: 'ALL' threshold_duration: 180 priority: 'CRITICAL' operator: 'ABOVE' violationTimeLimit: 'ONE_HOUR' valueFunction: 'SINGLE_VALUE' Copy With the alert condition added to the configuration, you can apply the update, which will create a NRQL alert condition and add it to your policy. kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml Copy To confirm that the NRQL alert condition was created successfully, refresh your alert policy. If you see a new alert condition added to the alert policy, it was a success. To finish things off, you'll create and add an alert channel to your alert policy. For example, maybe you want to send an email out to your team when your alert condition is triggered. Try it out now We have a Kubernetes test cluster ready for you in 2 minutes.

Note Some browsers automatically disable the use of iframes. If the module isn't loading please check your browser settings. Your browser does not support iframes. What’s next? Nice work — now you can manage your New Relic alert policies and NRQL alert conditions with code that integrates seamlessly within your Kubernetes workflow. This provides the ability to configure and manage your alerts with a domain-specific pattern, providing consistency and maintainability. You also gain the benefits of code reviews for any potential changes moving forward. As you and your team move forward, you might need to adjust some of the configuration values to better fit your needs.

      "body": "New Relic allows you to collect custom attributes. For example, you can create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. This document contains links to docs on how to do this for APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring. APM: Record custom attributes Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "New Relic APM's Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the entity explorer. View your app's summary page Here are two ways to reach the Summary page: Entity explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer > (select an app). APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question question circle icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your Browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser details In order to view Browser details, you must enable this feature from Browser settings. However, if your app has never reported any browser monitoring data, you must first enable it from the application's settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Application. From the New Relic Browser section, select the Enable browser monitoring? checkbox. Select Apdex values for browser monitoring and app server requests, or leave the defaults. Optional: Select up to five countries or regions for browser monitoring to highlight on the Geography page. Select Save application settings. To enable additional features, follow standard procedures from Browser > (selected app) > Settings. After New Relic Browser instrumentation is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding Browser Summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, New Relic APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to Browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to Browser via the API, you'll need this information: An admin API key for the New Relic account The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to Browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in Browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the Browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to Browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to Browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the Browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to Browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line. Note that the source map can come from a local file or a remote URL. npm install -g @newrelic/publish-sourcemap publish-sourcemap PATH_TO_SOURCE_MAP_FILE (local or remote) PATH_TO_ORIGINAL_FILE --nrAdminKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY --applicationId=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID npm command line: List published maps Here's an example of listing published source maps: list-sourcemaps --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --nrAdminKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_KEY Options: --applicationId Browser application id --nrAdminKey New Relic admin API key npm command line: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map: delete-sourcemap --applicationId=YOUR_APP_ID --nrAdminKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY --sourcemapId=YOUR_SOURCE_MAP_ID Options: --applicationId Browser application id --nrAdminKey New Relic admin API key --sourcemapId Unique id generated for a source map Here are some examples of using the npm module to publish from client-side JavaScript: npm via Node.js script: Publish Here's an example of publishing a source map via a Node.js script: var publishSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).publishSourcemap publishSourcemap({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, nrAdminKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY' }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Sourcemap upload done')}) npm via Node.js script: List published maps Here's an example of listing all published source maps: var listSourcemaps = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).listSourcemaps listSourcemaps({ sourcemapPath: 'SOURCE_MAP_FULL_PATH', javascriptUrl: 'JS_URL', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, nrAdminKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY', }, function (err, res) { console.log(err || res.body)}) npm via Node.js script: Delete Here's an example of deleting a source map file via a Node.js script: var deleteSourcemap = require(‘@newrelic/publish-sourcemap’).deleteSourcemap deleteSourcemap({ sourcemapId: 'SOURCE_MAP_ID', applicationId: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID, nrAdminKey: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY', }, function (err) { console.log(err || 'Deleted source map')}) When you're done, go to the JS errors page in Browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Use API via curl Below are some examples of using curl to publish, list, and delete source maps: curl: Upload maps An example of using API via curl to publish maps to Browser: curl -H \"Newrelic-Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY\" \\ -F \"sourcemap=@SOURCE_MAP_PATH\" \\ -F \"javascriptUrl=JS_URL\" \\ -F \"releaseId=YOUR_RELEASE_ID\" \\ -F \"releaseName=YOUR_UI_PAGE\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps curl: List existing maps Below is an example of how to get a list of source maps previously uploaded to New Relic via curl. New Relic returns the source map's unique SOURCEMAP_ID and its components: curl \\ -H \"Newrelic-Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps curl: Delete map To delete a source map: Use the GET endpoint to list existing source maps and locate the SOURCEMAP_ID. Run the following command via curl: curl -X DELETE \\ -H \"Newrelic-Api-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY\" \\ https://sourcemaps.service.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APP_ID/sourcemaps/SOURCEMAP_ID When you're done, go to the JS errors page in Browser, select an error grouping, and see if your error stack traces have been un-minified. Troubleshoot source maps If you are having trouble generating source maps from your build system, or if your errors in Browser are remaining minified, see the source maps troubleshooting documentation.

Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation).

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers. This fix brings the Java Agent into compliance with the behavior of other New Relic Agents. Fixes an issue in which custom Hystrix Commands that are subclassed multiple times in Groovy cause an application to throw an exception on startup.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other entities, see Obtain references. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other entities, see Obtain references. Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Implement cross application tracing To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic entities. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic entities. Obtain references to New Relic entities Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the first call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record Insights custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic entities.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property.

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Other apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimit: TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS }) { id name } } NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimit: TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS }) { id name baselineDirection } } NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimit: TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragmentsto request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. 1. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query sinceValue } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimit } } } } } } 2. Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimit } } } } } 3. Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Here'a an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "This document provides examples of how to use New Relic NerdGraph to query and modify your cloud integration configuration data, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can also query NRQL data. These examples for querying cloud integration configuration data use GraphQL queries and mutations: Queries: requests that are intended to only fetch data Mutations: requests that create or update data on the server Requirements Before querying cloud integration data with NerdGraph, ensure you have: Followed the instructions to connect cloud integrations with New Relic. Created an API key. Access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer To access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: Go to https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Add any of the following examples. Query examples Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). Queries in NerdGraph are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Available provider accounts This query returns a list of all provider accounts available in your infrastructure data. Depending on the provider, additional properties can be requested. For example, for GCP, you can also ask for the serviceAccountId property, which is needed when linking a new GCP project to New Relic. Anonymous: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug ... on CloudGcpProvider { serviceAccountId } } } } } } Named: query cloudProviders { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } } } } } Specific provider account information This query returns information about a specific provider account for your Amazon AWS integration. The properties id, name, slug are requested, along with a list of integrations available to be monitored. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { id slug name services { id slug name } } } } } } Specific integration data from a specific cloud provider This query returns information about a specific cloud service integration of a provider. In this example, the integration is the Amazon AWS ALB monitoring integration and the provider is AWS. The properties id, name, slug, and isAllowed are requested with the available configuration parameters. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { service(slug: \"alb\") { id name slug isEnabled } } } } } } List of enabled cloud accounts This query returns the list of cloud accounts enabled with your New Relic account. (Your cloud account associates your New Relic account and a specific provider account with your integration.) You can enable multiple cloud provider accounts in the same New Relic account, even with the same cloud provider. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { id name createdAt provider { id name } } } } } } Specific linked account data This query returns information about a linked account, including the properties name, providerId, and a list of the cloud integrations enabled for monitoring. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integrations { id name createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Enabled cloud integrations for all linked accounts This query returns all monitored integrations for all the provider cloud accounts. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { name provider { id name } integrations { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Specific cloud integration data for a specific linked account This query returns information about a specific integration from a specific linked account. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integration(id: <INTEGRATION_ID>) { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Mutation examples Mutations are requests that are intended to have side effects, such as creating or updating data on the server. Mutations require the keyword mutation and the name of the mutation. NerdGraph mutations are restricted to a subset of all possible mutations. Link an account This mutation allows linking cloud provider accounts to a New Relic account, creating one or more linked accounts. It can link one specific cloud provider account (for example aws) to the New Relic account or multiple cloud provider accounts to one New Relic account. Required: The parameter <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME> is required and cannot be empty. It must be unique in your New Relic account. Other parameters are specific to the provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) and are also required. In the following sections, you can see which parameters are required for each provider account. After linking an account the createdAt and updatedAt values are equal. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accounts: { accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Link an Amazon AWS account This mutation links an Amazon AWS provider account to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Link a Microsoft Azure account This mutation links a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, applicationId: <azure_application_id>, clientSecret: <azure_application_key>, tenantId: <azure_tenant_id>, subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Link a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project This mutation links a GCP project to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, projectId: <GCP_PROJECT_ID> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Rename one or more cloud accounts This mutation allows you to rename one or more linked provider accounts. The name parameter is required, cannot be empty, and must be unique within your New Relic account. mutation { cloudRenameAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: [ { id: <linked_account_id_1>, name: <new_provider_account_name> }, { id: <linked_account_id_2>, name: <new_provider_account_name> } ] ) { linkedAccounts { id name } } } Enable an integration in a cloud account This mutation allows you to enable the monitoring of one or more specific cloud integrations in an existing cloud account. With this mutation, New Relic records data for the enabled integration from the provider account. For each provider account you have access to different input parameters, matching each available service. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, <other_parameters> }] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Enable an integration in multiple cloud accounts If you have many provider accounts linked, you can enable the same integration in the many cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug> : [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_2> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Enable multiple integrations in multiple cloud accounts If you have multiple cloud accounts linked, you can also enable multiple integrations in multiple linked cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug_1>: { <integration_slug_1>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_1> } ] <integration_slug_2>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_2> } ] }, <provider_slug_2>: { <integration_slug_3>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_3>}, { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_4>} ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Modify an integration's configuration (regions, polling intervals, etc.) This mutation also allows you to modify one or more cloud integrations and change one or more configuration parameters. Each service will have specific parameters that you can modify. For parameters of a type list (for example, awsRegion) supply the full list. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug>: { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: <new_polling_interval>, <parameter_1>: <value_1>, <parameter_N>: <value_N>, }] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval, <parameter_1>, <parameter_N> } } errors { type message } } } Disable (remove) an integration This mutation allows you to disable an integration and stop data collection for the specific cloud integration. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { : { : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id name authLabel provider { id } } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Unlink account This mutation allows you to unlink cloud provider accounts from New Relic account. This action can not be undone. However, you can link the account again, but account history will still be lost. mutation { cloudUnlinkAccount ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } } ) { unlinkedAccounts { id name } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Enable an Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To enable an Amazon AWS integration: Send query to fetch account data Send a query to fetch data about the account, specifically available providers and already created provider accounts: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } linkedAccounts { name integrations { id name } } } } } } Link AWS provider account Link an AWS provider account, if there is not one already linked or if you want to link another AWS account: Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter. Provide a name for the provider account in the <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>. Include the ARN of the AWS role used to fetch data from your AWS account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } errors { type message } } } Enable Amazon AWS SQS integration Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Enable integration in multiple provider accounts If you have multiple accounts with the same provider account, you can enable the same integration in multiple provider accounts at the same time. Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider accounts in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_n> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_2>, configuration_param_1: value_1, configuration_param_2: value_2 } ] } } }) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Change polling interval for Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To change the polling interval of an AWS integration: Update the polling interval To update the polling interval for an Amazon AWS SQS integration, use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the id of the linked provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value: mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws : { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: 300 } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval } } errors { type message } } } Disable Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To disable an AWS integration: Disable the SQS integration Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the linked cloud account the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id accountId name } errors { type message } } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Add the NerdGraphQuery component to an application 20 minutes This guide steps you through the process of adding the `NerdGraphQuery` component to a sample transaction overview application. This allows you to query data from your New Relic account and add it to a dropdown menu. NerdGraph is our GraphQL implementation. GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST: The client, not the server, determines what data is returned. You can easily collect data from multiple sources. For example, in a single query, you can get account information, infrastructure data, and issue a NRQL request. Note Before completing this exercise, you can experiment with GraphQL queries in our NerdGraph API explorer. We also have a 14-minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of our CLI quick start, and be sure to make a copy of your account ID from step 1 because you’ll need it later. Note If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. Here's an example using HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Copy Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory use-nerdgraph-nerdlet: cd nr1-how-to/use-nerdgraph/nerdlets/use-nerdgraph-nerdlet Copy Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Note Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the /nr1-howto/use-nerdgraph directory: cd ../.. Copy Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), click Apps, and then click Use NerdGraph. After launching the Use NerdGraph application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your account: Add the NerdGraphQuery component Now you can create a dropdown menu for changing the account the application is viewing. The first step is to import the NerdGraphQuery component into the application's index.js file. Note If you need more details about our example below, see the APIs and components page on https://developer.newrelic.com Step 1 of 3 Add the NerdGraphQuery component into the first StackItem inside of the return in the index.js file: <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { console.log({ loading, error, data }); if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return null; }} </NerdGraphQuery>; Copy Step 2 of 3 The NerdGraphQuery component takes a query object that states the source you want to access and the data you want returned. Add the following code to your index.js file in the render method: Note In the browser console, you can see the data from your query returned in an object that follows the same structure of the object in the initial query. const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; Copy Step 3 of 3 To take the data returned by the NerdGraph query and display it in the application, replace the return null in the current NerdGraphQuery component with this return statement: return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; Copy When you go back to the browser and view your application, you see a new headline showing the name of your account returned from NerdGraph: How to use NerdGraphQuery.query At this point, you have implemented the NerdGraphQuery component with the application's render method and displayed the return data within the transaction overview application. Here's what you need to do next: Query NerdGraph inside of the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Save the returned data for later use in the application. Step 1 of 2 This code takes the response from NerdGraph and makes sure the results are processed, stored into the application state, and logged to the browser console for viewing. Add this code into the index.js file just under the constructor: componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({query: gql}) //The NerdGraphQuery.query method called with the query object to get your account data is stored in the accounts variable. accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } Copy Step 2 of 2 After the data is stored into state, display a selection so users can change accounts and update the application. To do this, add this code to index.js for the second StackItem in the return statement: { accounts && ( <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)} > {accounts.map((a) => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ); })} </Select> </StackItem> ); } Copy Review the results of the NerdGraph query After you complete these steps, look at the application in your browser, and note the following: The dropdown menu now displays the data returned from the NerdGraphQuery.query and allows you to select an account. After you select a new account, the application shows data from the new selection. The final index.js file should have code similar to the code below. This completed sample is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, HeadingText, Grid, GridItem, Stack, StackItem, Select, SelectItem, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart } from 'nr1' import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class UseNerdgraphNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.state = { accountId: <YOUR ACCOUNT ID>, accounts: null, selectedAccount: null, } } componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({ query: gql }) accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } selectAccount(option) { this.setState({ accountId: option.id, selectedAccount: option }); } render() { const { accountId, accounts, selectedAccount } = this.state; console.log({ accountId, accounts, selectedAccount }); const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; const variables = { id: accountId, }; const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <Stack fullWidth horizontalType={Stack.HORIZONTAL_TYPE.FILL} gapType={Stack.GAP_TYPE.EXTRA_LOOSE} spacingType={[Stack.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} directionType={Stack.DIRECTION_TYPE.VERTICAL}> <StackItem> <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({loading, error, data}) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </StackItem> {accounts && <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)}> {accounts.map(a => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ) })} </Select> </StackItem> } <StackItem> <hr /> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={trxOverview+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={avgResTime+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={responseCodes+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={errCount+since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </StackItem> </Stack> ) } } Copy Summary Now that you've completed all the steps in this example, you've successfully queried data from your account using the NerdGraphQuery component in two methods: Using the NerdGraphQuery component inside the application's render method and then passing the returned data into the children's components.

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account, and to have Node.js installed on your machine. See [Setting up your development environment](/build-apps/set-up-dev-env) for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps*, and then in the Other apps section, you should see a Create a table** launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from `nr1`; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors.

      "body": "Collect data from any source 15 min New Relic products report a lot of data “out of the box.” When you use products like APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure monitoring, or an integration, by default you receive performance data. But you may want to bring data into New Relic that isn't collected by default. Maybe you want an API-based solution that doesn't require install of an agent. Maybe you want to bring telemetry data from another analysis service into New Relic. This page describes several ways to get data into New Relic. Step 1 of 6 Agent APIs If you use our APM, Browser, or Mobile agents to report data, you can use their associated APIs to report custom data. For example, if you monitor your application with the our APM Python agent, you can use the Python agent API to set up custom instrumentation. See the agent APIs. Step 2 of 6 Telemetry SDK Our Telemetry SDKs are language wrappers for our Trace API and Metric API (and eventually our Log API and Event API). These SDKs let you easily send metrics and trace data to New Relic without needing to install an agent. For customers, we offer open-source exporters and integrations that use the Telemetry SDKs to send metrics and trace data: Istio adaptor Prometheus OpenMetrics (for Docker | for Kubernetes) OpenCensus exporter (for Go | for Python) DropWizard exporter Micrometer exporter Want to build your own solution? See our Telemetry SDK docs. Step 3 of 6 Trace API Our Trace API lets you send distributed tracing data to New Relic and consolidate tracing data from multiple sources in one place. We accept trace data in two formats: Zipkin format New Relic format (if you don’t have Zipkin-format data, you’d use this) 1 curl -i -X POST https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ 5 -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ 6 -d '[ 7 { 8 \"common\": { 9 \"attributes\": { 10 \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", 11 \"host\": \"host123.test.com\" 12 } 13 }, 14 \"spans\": [ 15 { 16 \"trace.id\": \"123456\", 17 \"id\": \"ABC\", 18 \"attributes\": { 19 \"duration.ms\": 12.53, 20 \"name\": \"/home\" 21 } 22 }, 23 { 24 \"trace.id\": \"123456\", 25 \"id\": \"DEF\", 26 \"attributes\": { 27 \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", 28 \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", 29 \"duration.ms\": 2.97, 30 \"name\": \"/auth\", 31 \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" 32 } 33 } 34 ] 35 } 36 ]' Copy Step 4 of 6 Metric API You can use our Metric API to send metric data to New Relic from any source. 1 curl -i -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 { 6 \"metrics\": [ 7 { 8 \"name\": \"memory.heap\", 9 \"type\": \"gauge\", 10 \"value\": 2.3, 11 \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, 12 \"attributes\": { 13 \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" 14 } 15 } 16 ] 17 } 18 ]' Copy Step 5 of 6 Event API For sending arbitrary events to New Relic, you can use our Event API. We save these events as a new event type, which can then be queried via NRQL. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Event API.) 1 curl -i -X POST https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/events \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"x-insert-key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 { 6 \"eventType\": \"LoginEvent\", 7 \"service\": \"login-service\", 8 \"customerId\": \"xyz\" 9 } 10 ]' Copy Step 6 of 6 Log API If our existing logging integrations don’t meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send any arbitrary log data to New Relic. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Log API.) 1 curl -i -X POST https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 \"logs\": [ 6 { 7 \"timestamp\": 1593538496000, 8 \"message\": \"User xyz logged in\", 9 \"service\": \"login-service\", 10 \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" 11 } 12 ] 13 ]' Copy",

Overview of reporting custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data, and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetics Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools.

This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. General requirements How long custom data is retained depends on your Insights subscription and its associated data retention. When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1 MB maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. This is not a complete list. In general, it's a good practice to avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Additional Browser PageAction requirements For additional requirements for using New Relic Browser's custom PageAction event, see Insert custom data via New Relic Browser agent. Additional Event API requirements For more requirements and details for the Event API, see Event API. Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter If you have a use case that requires to need to store more than 250 unique event types in a given 24-hour period, file a New Relic support ticket at support.newrelic.com.

      "body": "Add the NerdGraphQuery component to an application 20 minutes This guide steps you through the process of adding the `NerdGraphQuery` component to a sample transaction overview application. This allows you to query data from your New Relic account and add it to a dropdown menu. NerdGraph is our GraphQL implementation. GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST: The client, not the server, determines what data is returned. You can easily collect data from multiple sources. For example, in a single query, you can get account information, infrastructure data, and issue a NRQL request. Note Before completing this exercise, you can experiment with GraphQL queries in our NerdGraph API explorer. We also have a 14-minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of our CLI quick start, and be sure to make a copy of your account ID from step 1 because you’ll need it later. Note If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. Here's an example using HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Copy Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory use-nerdgraph-nerdlet: cd nr1-how-to/use-nerdgraph/nerdlets/use-nerdgraph-nerdlet Copy Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Note Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the /nr1-howto/use-nerdgraph directory: cd ../.. Copy Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), click Apps, and then click Use NerdGraph. After launching the Use NerdGraph application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your account: Add the NerdGraphQuery component Now you can create a dropdown menu for changing the account the application is viewing. The first step is to import the NerdGraphQuery component into the application's index.js file. Note If you need more details about our example below, see the APIs and components page on https://developer.newrelic.com Step 1 of 3 Add the NerdGraphQuery component into the first StackItem inside of the return in the index.js file: <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { console.log({ loading, error, data }); if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return null; }} </NerdGraphQuery>; Copy Step 2 of 3 The NerdGraphQuery component takes a query object that states the source you want to access and the data you want returned. Add the following code to your index.js file in the render method: Note In the browser console, you can see the data from your query returned in an object that follows the same structure of the object in the initial query. const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; Copy Step 3 of 3 To take the data returned by the NerdGraph query and display it in the application, replace the return null in the current NerdGraphQuery component with this return statement: return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; Copy When you go back to the browser and view your application, you see a new headline showing the name of your account returned from NerdGraph: How to use NerdGraphQuery.query At this point, you have implemented the NerdGraphQuery component with the application's render method and displayed the return data within the transaction overview application. Here's what you need to do next: Query NerdGraph inside of the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Save the returned data for later use in the application. Step 1 of 2 This code takes the response from NerdGraph and makes sure the results are processed, stored into the application state, and logged to the browser console for viewing. Add this code into the index.js file just under the constructor: componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({query: gql}) //The NerdGraphQuery.query method called with the query object to get your account data is stored in the accounts variable. accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } Copy Step 2 of 2 After the data is stored into state, display a selection so users can change accounts and update the application. To do this, add this code to index.js for the second StackItem in the return statement: { accounts && ( <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)} > {accounts.map((a) => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ); })} </Select> </StackItem> ); } Copy Review the results of the NerdGraph query After you complete these steps, look at the application in your browser, and note the following: The dropdown menu now displays the data returned from the NerdGraphQuery.query and allows you to select an account. After you select a new account, the application shows data from the new selection. The final index.js file should have code similar to the code below. This completed sample is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, HeadingText, Grid, GridItem, Stack, StackItem, Select, SelectItem, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart } from 'nr1' import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class UseNerdgraphNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.state = { accountId: <YOUR ACCOUNT ID>, accounts: null, selectedAccount: null, } } componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({ query: gql }) accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } selectAccount(option) { this.setState({ accountId: option.id, selectedAccount: option }); } render() { const { accountId, accounts, selectedAccount } = this.state; console.log({ accountId, accounts, selectedAccount }); const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; const variables = { id: accountId, }; const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <Stack fullWidth horizontalType={Stack.HORIZONTAL_TYPE.FILL} gapType={Stack.GAP_TYPE.EXTRA_LOOSE} spacingType={[Stack.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} directionType={Stack.DIRECTION_TYPE.VERTICAL}> <StackItem> <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({loading, error, data}) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </StackItem> {accounts && <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)}> {accounts.map(a => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ) })} </Select> </StackItem> } <StackItem> <hr /> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={trxOverview+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={avgResTime+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={responseCodes+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={errCount+since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </StackItem> </Stack> ) } } Copy Summary Now that you've completed all the steps in this example, you've successfully queried data from your account using the NerdGraphQuery component in two methods: Using the NerdGraphQuery component inside the application's render method and then passing the returned data into the children's components.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "Quickly tag a set of resources 5 min Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us # Set the profile as default newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Copy Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Note Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. # Adding a single tag newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value # Adding multiple tags newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document will explain how to report your own custom events and attributes. Overview of reporting custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data, and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetics Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn about how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see Event data retention.

For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoint details and maximum limits All trace data is sent via a POST to: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Data limits and rules: Condition Limit with subscription Max age of span timestamp values 20 minutes. timestamp must be within 20 minutes of current time at ingest, or within 20 minutes from the time the last span with the same trace.id was received by New Relic. Max payload size 1 MB (gzip compression supported) Max requests per minute 100K Max spans per minute per account family Dependent on agreement. Max limit: 2M. Max spans per trace 50K Max attributes per span 200 Max span attribute value length 4000 characters Allowed HTTP protocols HTTPS only Cross-account visibility of span details Potential data obfuscation To see an example of how span limits are enforced, see Exceeding limits. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from New Relic APM agents. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires the Event API insert key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Exceeding span limits When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute. Minute Spans sent to API Total for past 10 minutes 8:59 60,000 600,000 9:00 40,000 580,000 9:01 50,000 570,000 9:02 250,000 760,000 9:03 220,000 920,000 9:04 125,000 985,000 9:05 70,000 995,000 9:06 50,000 985,000 9:07 40,000 965,000 9:08 40,000 945,000 9:09 40,000 925,000 For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Other apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account, and to have Node.js installed on your machine. See [Setting up your development environment](/build-apps/set-up-dev-env) for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps*, and then in the Other apps section, you should see a Create a table** launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us # Set the profile as default newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Copy Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Note Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. # Adding a single tag newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value # Adding multiple tags newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands.

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contributing to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix.

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "You can create alert conditions using NRQL queries. Create NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL condition: When you start to create a condition, where it prompts you to Select a product, click NRQL. Tips on creating a NRQL condition: NRQL conditions Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For some condition types, you can create a Description. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Configure whether and how open violations are force-closed. Adjust the evaluation offset. Create a concise and descriptive condition name. (NerdGraph API Only) Provide a text description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Troubleshooting procedures Optional: To include your organization's procedures for handling the incident, add the runbook URL to the condition. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Offset the query time window Every minute, we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows. The start time depends on the value you select in the NRQL condition's Advanced settings > Evaluation offset. Example: Using the default time window to evaluate violations With the Evaluation offset at the default setting of three minutes, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend evaluating data from three minutes ago or longer. An offset of less than 3 minutes will trigger violations sooner, but you might see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Create a description You can define a description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by downstream systems.

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimit: TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS }) { id name } } NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimit: TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS }) { id name baselineDirection } } NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimit: TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragmentsto request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. 1. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query sinceValue } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimit } } } } } } 2. Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimit } } } } } 3. Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Here'a an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all. one.newrelic.com > Entity explorer: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor. The entity explorer brings together data reported from across all of New Relic. Entity categories include: Services: APM-monitored applications and services monitored. Hosts: your monitored infrastructure (your servers and hosts). Mobile applications: your mobile apps. Browser applications: your front-end browser apps. Integration-reported data: data from services monitored by our integrations, including our on-host integrations (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Health (alert) status The entity explorer shows a color-coded alert status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress. To see what an alert status means, mouse over it. To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity. NRQL alert conditions aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities. Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post. Filter by tag or entity name There are a couple ways to filter down to specific types of entities: Filter entities by tags: Use Filter with tags at the top of the page. For example, you may want to filter down to only entities tagged with production, or only entities with a specific AWS region tag. For more about tags, see Tagging. Filter by entity name: Use Search services by name at the top of the page. Entity data retention Availability of data depends on these factors: Scope Data retention Entity explorer and search In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist. Our database (accessible via NRQL query) For querying our database (for example, via the query builder or data explorer), availability is dependent on the data retention for that data type. As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.

      "body": "Add the NerdGraphQuery component to an application 20 minutes This guide steps you through the process of adding the `NerdGraphQuery` component to a sample transaction overview application. This allows you to query data from your New Relic account and add it to a dropdown menu. NerdGraph is our GraphQL implementation. GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST: The client, not the server, determines what data is returned. You can easily collect data from multiple sources. For example, in a single query, you can get account information, infrastructure data, and issue a NRQL request. Note Before completing this exercise, you can experiment with GraphQL queries in our NerdGraph API explorer. We also have a 14-minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of our CLI quick start, and be sure to make a copy of your account ID from step 1 because you’ll need it later. Note If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. Here's an example using HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Copy Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory use-nerdgraph-nerdlet: cd nr1-how-to/use-nerdgraph/nerdlets/use-nerdgraph-nerdlet Copy Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Note Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the /nr1-howto/use-nerdgraph directory: cd ../.. Copy Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), click Apps, and then click Use NerdGraph. After launching the Use NerdGraph application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your account: Add the NerdGraphQuery component Now you can create a dropdown menu for changing the account the application is viewing. The first step is to import the NerdGraphQuery component into the application's index.js file. Note If you need more details about our example below, see the APIs and components page on https://developer.newrelic.com Step 1 of 3 Add the NerdGraphQuery component into the first StackItem inside of the return in the index.js file: <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { console.log({ loading, error, data }); if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return null; }} </NerdGraphQuery>; Copy Step 2 of 3 The NerdGraphQuery component takes a query object that states the source you want to access and the data you want returned. Add the following code to your index.js file in the render method: Note In the browser console, you can see the data from your query returned in an object that follows the same structure of the object in the initial query. const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; Copy Step 3 of 3 To take the data returned by the NerdGraph query and display it in the application, replace the return null in the current NerdGraphQuery component with this return statement: return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; Copy When you go back to the browser and view your application, you see a new headline showing the name of your account returned from NerdGraph: How to use NerdGraphQuery.query At this point, you have implemented the NerdGraphQuery component with the application's render method and displayed the return data within the transaction overview application. Here's what you need to do next: Query NerdGraph inside of the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Save the returned data for later use in the application. Step 1 of 2 This code takes the response from NerdGraph and makes sure the results are processed, stored into the application state, and logged to the browser console for viewing. Add this code into the index.js file just under the constructor: componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({query: gql}) //The NerdGraphQuery.query method called with the query object to get your account data is stored in the accounts variable. accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } Copy Step 2 of 2 After the data is stored into state, display a selection so users can change accounts and update the application. To do this, add this code to index.js for the second StackItem in the return statement: { accounts && ( <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)} > {accounts.map((a) => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ); })} </Select> </StackItem> ); } Copy Review the results of the NerdGraph query After you complete these steps, look at the application in your browser, and note the following: The dropdown menu now displays the data returned from the NerdGraphQuery.query and allows you to select an account. After you select a new account, the application shows data from the new selection. The final index.js file should have code similar to the code below. This completed sample is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, HeadingText, Grid, GridItem, Stack, StackItem, Select, SelectItem, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart } from 'nr1' import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class UseNerdgraphNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.state = { accountId: <YOUR ACCOUNT ID>, accounts: null, selectedAccount: null, } } componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({ query: gql }) accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } selectAccount(option) { this.setState({ accountId: option.id, selectedAccount: option }); } render() { const { accountId, accounts, selectedAccount } = this.state; console.log({ accountId, accounts, selectedAccount }); const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; const variables = { id: accountId, }; const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <Stack fullWidth horizontalType={Stack.HORIZONTAL_TYPE.FILL} gapType={Stack.GAP_TYPE.EXTRA_LOOSE} spacingType={[Stack.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} directionType={Stack.DIRECTION_TYPE.VERTICAL}> <StackItem> <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({loading, error, data}) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </StackItem> {accounts && <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)}> {accounts.map(a => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ) })} </Select> </StackItem> } <StackItem> <hr /> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={trxOverview+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={avgResTime+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={responseCodes+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={errCount+since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </StackItem> </Stack> ) } } Copy Summary Now that you've completed all the steps in this example, you've successfully queried data from your account using the NerdGraphQuery component in two methods: Using the NerdGraphQuery component inside the application's render method and then passing the returned data into the children's components.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

Complete steps 1–4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you’ll need it later. Note If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Copy Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Copy Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Note Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / add - time - picker; Copy Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Note If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the PlatformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Note You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Note You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the PlatformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Note This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. This document explains: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our developer site. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate Nerdpack. Use the CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually. You can use the CLI command nr1 create and choose to select either a Nerdlet or launcher. This may be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For a lesson on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see the workshop. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the CLI nr1 create command, it has this file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │ └── my-nerdlet-launcher │ ├── icon.png │ └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │ └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │ ├── index.js │ ├── nr1.json │ └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │ ├── js-tokens │ ├── loose-envify │ ├── object-assign │ ├── prop-types │ ├── react │ ├── react-dom │ ├── react-is │ └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files: index.js The JavaScript code. Here's what the default file looks like when a Nerdlet is generated with the CLI nr1 create: import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1> } } nr1.json Configuration file. Here is the default file generated by the CLI nr1 create command: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the New Relic One entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all New Relic Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{\"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\"}], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } To see this application in the UI, you would go to the New Relic One entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss The file for CSS styles (Sass SCSS syntax). Launcher file structure When an application with a launcher file has been deployed, its launcher is located on the New Relic One home page (one.newrelic.com). A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher; this may be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. A launcher folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. Here is the default file template created by the nr1 create command: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the one.newrelic.com home page when an application is deployed.

Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Set up New Relic using the Kubernetes operator 20 min Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. You can use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic entities. In this guide you'll learn how to set up New Relic for the first time with the official New Relic Kubernetes operator. More specifically, you'll provision an alert policy with NRQL conditions in your New Relic account using Kubernetes. Before you begin This walkthrough assumes you’ve already deployed a Kubernetes cluster. You could even create a local cluster on your machine with kind. To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Kubernetes. To complete the full exercise, you’ll need to: Deploy a New Relic agent if you haven't done so yet. Install New Relic for your application. Install kubectl and point it at the correct cluster; this determines the cluster where you’ll install the New Relic operator. Install kustomize. Step 1 of 3 Installing the operator on your Kubernetes cluster First, install cert-manager, which automatically provisions and manages TLS certificates in Kubernetes. kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.15.0/cert-manager.yaml Copy Next, install the Kubernetes operator. kustomize build https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-kubernetes-operator/config/default | kubectl apply -f - Copy To confirm the installation was successful, run a few kubectl commands to check the status of the Kubernetes operator. Ensure the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system, has been applied: kubectl get namespaces Copy The output should be similar to the following, which includes the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system: NAME STATUS AGE cert-manager Active 4m35s default Active 20m kube-node-lease Active 20m kube-public Active 20m kube-system Active 20m newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system Active 3m48s Copy Now, make sure the Kubernetes operator's controller manager is running: Note: Don't forget to include the --namespace (shorthand -n) option when running kubectl get pods to ensure you're inspecting resources within the correct namespace. kubectl get pods --namespace newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system Copy You should see output similar to the following: NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-7b9c64f58crwg9j 2/2 Running 0 157m Copy If your output is similar to the example shown, you’re ready for the next step. If you don’t see a pod named newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-<hash>, double check your Kubernetes configuration to ensure you’re within the correct context and pointing to the correct cluster. Step 2 of 3 Creating your first alert policy To kick things off, start small. First, create an alert policy with the minimum required configuration, then add a NRQL alert condition to the policy, which will add the condition to the policy in New Relic. A minimal alert policy configuration is represented in the code below. For the sake of this walkthrough, name this file new_relic_alert_policy.yaml. Note: For help locating your personal API key, check out New Relic's personal API key documentation. apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic personal API key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' Copy Now run the kubectl apply command to create your alert policy. kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml Copy You'll see output that reads similar to the following: alertspolicy.nr.k8s.newrelic.com/my-policy created Copy Confirm that your alert policy was created by viewing your policies at alerts.newrelic.com/accounts/{your account ID}/policies. You can search for your new policy by its name. In this case, search for \"Alert Policy Created With k8s.\" You should see your new alert policy. Next it’s time to add a NRQL alert condition to the policy using the same configuration file. Step 3 of 3 Add NRQL alert conditions to your alert policy In the previous section you created an alert policy; now, you’ll add some alert conditions to the policy so you can trigger alerts when certain metrics are out of line. In your new_relic_alert_policy.yaml file, add a NRQL alert condition to the policy that will alert you when an application's average overall response time is above five seconds for a three minute period. Note: To receive notifications when an alert is triggered, add notification channels to your alert policy, with this code. # The policy from the previous steps apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic personal API key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' # Add a NRQL alert condition to the policy conditions: - spec: type: 'NRQL' name: 'NRQL Alert Condition Created With k8s' nrql: query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'YOUR APP NAME'\" evaluationOffset: 3 enabled: true terms: - threshold: '5' threshold_occurrences: 'ALL' threshold_duration: 180 priority: 'CRITICAL' operator: 'ABOVE' violationTimeLimit: 'ONE_HOUR' valueFunction: 'SINGLE_VALUE' Copy With the alert condition added to the configuration, you can apply the update, which will create a NRQL alert condition and add it to your policy. kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml Copy To confirm that the NRQL alert condition was created successfully, refresh your alert policy. If you see a new alert condition added to the alert policy, it was a success. To finish things off, you'll create and add an alert channel to your alert policy. For example, maybe you want to send an email out to your team when your alert condition is triggered. Try it out now We have a Kubernetes test cluster ready for you in 2 minutes. By following this on-line tutorial, you will learn how to: Deploy the New Relic agent in a Kubernetes environment Use the New Relic Kubernetes operator Some tips to use the on-line tutorial window: Accept the cookies, so you can see the menu bar. Click anywhere in the tutorial window to start. It will take about 2 minutes for your environment to be ready. Press CTRL-l or type clear to clear the terminal window Click on the finish flag icon in the bottom menu to hide or show the instructions Good luck! Note Some browsers automatically disable the use of iframes. If the module isn't loading please check your browser settings. Your browser does not support iframes. What’s next? Nice work — now you can manage your New Relic alert policies and NRQL alert conditions with code that integrates seamlessly within your Kubernetes workflow. This provides the ability to configure and manage your alerts with a domain-specific pattern, providing consistency and maintainability. You also gain the benefits of code reviews for any potential changes moving forward. As you and your team move forward, you might need to adjust some of the configuration values to better fit your needs.

      "body": "Set up New Relic using Terraform 20 min Terraform is a popular infrastructure as code software tool by HashiCorp. You can use it to provision all kind of infrastructure and services, including New Relic entities. In this guide you'll learn how to set up New Relic for the first time with Terraform. More specifically, you are going to provision an alert policy with notifications in your New Relic account using Terraform. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Install Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 8 Bootstrap your provider configuration Our Terraform Provider detects the environment variables above when running Terraform commands. You can set the environment variables in your .bash_profile or .bashrc file. Set the following environment variables: Set your New Relic Personal API key with the NEW_RELIC_API_KEY environment variable. Most Personal API keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Set your New Relic Admin API key with the NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY environment variable. Most Admin API keys begin with the prefix NRAA-. Set your New Relic Account ID with the NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID environment variable. Set your New Relic region with the NEW_RELIC_REGION environment variable. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at rpm.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at rpm.eu.newrelic.com. # Add this to your .bash_profile export NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... export NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY=NRAA-... export NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 export NEW_RELIC_REGION=US # Or set it inline when running `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`: $ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... terraform apply Copy Step 2 of 8 Start with a provider configuration To connect Terraform with New Relic, you need to set New Relic as a provider in your Terraform configuration file, so that Terraform can create and manage New Relic resources in your account. To set New Relic as a provider, create a Terraform configuration file (main.tf). This code sets newrelic as the Terraform provider and provisions an empty alert policy as the resource. provider \"newrelic\" {} resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"alert_policy_name\" { name = \"My Alert Policy Name\" } Copy Step 3 of 8 Initialize and test your setup After adding New Relic as a provider, initialize the working directory from the command line using terraform init. Once you've successfully initialized the working directory, test Terraform's execution plan using terraform plan to confirm that you've the right setup. # Initialize the working directory $ terraform init # Test the Terraform plan $ terraform plan Copy plan performs a dry run of your Terraform configuration, so nothing is actually provisioned. Always run plan to test your configuration before applying it. Step 4 of 8 Add a data source The alert policy you defined in main.tf does not contain any alert condition. You are going to add an alert condition linked to your application. To store your application's information, you need to add a data source. provider \"newrelic\" {} # Data Source data \"newrelic_entity\" \"app_name\" { name = \"my-app\" # This must be an exact match of your app name in New Relic (case sensitive) domain = \"APM\" type = \"APPLICATION\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"alert_policy_name\" { name = \"My Alert Policy Name\" } Copy Step 5 of 8 Add an alert condition to the alert policy Now you can add the alert condition. For example, you can create a critical alert condition that is triggered when the Apdex of your application falls below 0.75 for five minutes. provider \"newrelic\" {} data \"newrelic_entity\" \"app_name\" { name = \"my-app\" domain = \"APM\" type = \"APPLICATION\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"alert_policy_name\" { name = \"My Alert Policy Name\" } # Alert condition resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"alert_condition_name\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.alert_policy_name.id name = \"My Alert Condition Name\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.app_name.application_id] metric = \"apdex\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"below\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"0.75\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a notification channel Alert policies use notification channels to inform you about incidents and active alerts. To add a notification channel to your alert policy, add the following snippet to your configuration file. When the alert condition is triggered, the notification channel sends an email to the specified recipients. You can send notifications using different tools and channels, such as Slack, by changing the type of your alert channel. # Notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"alert_notification_email\" { name = \"paul@example.com\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"fab@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } # Link the above notification channel to your policy resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"alert_policy_email\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.alert_policy_name.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.alert_notification_email.id ] } Copy Step 7 of 8 Apply your Terraform configuration The last step is provisioning the resources you've configured in main.tf, so that the alert policy is enabled in your New Relic account for your application. To apply the Terraform configuration and provision the resources in your New Relic account, run terraform apply. Answer yes when prompted to apply the changes. Once the apply process is complete, you should see the new alert policy you've provisioned using Terraform, and its alert conditions, in your New Relic account. You can run terraform apply every time you need to make changes to your configuration. To eliminate the resources you've provisioned, run terraform destroy. Step 8 of 8 Optional: Use the apm module for faster configuration In the Terraform Registry you can find our apm module, which simplifies Terraform's configuration. apm creates an alert policy, a Synthetics monitor, and several alert conditions for a given application reporting data into New Relic. To use our apm module with Terraform: Set newrelic/apm/newrelic as the module source. Add your account_id and application_name. Define your application_url (if any). Here is a configuration example with overridden default values. Initialize the working directory using terraform initto download and enable the module. Tip The apm module doesn't create a notification channel, so you would still have to define one. data \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"pager\" { name = \"Page Developer Toolkit Team\" } module \"dummy-app-monitor\" { source = \"newrelic/apm/newrelic\" account_id = 2520528 application_name = \"Dummy App\" # An Apdex alert condition will be created with sensible defaults without the use of these attributes. apdex_warning_threshold = 0.9 apdex_critical_threshold = 0.8 # An error rate alert condition will be created with sensible defaults without the use of these attributes. error_rate_warning_threshold = 5 error_rate_critical_threshold = 10 # Specifying an application URL will provision a Synthetic monitor and associated alert condition. application_url = \"https://www.dummyapp.com\" synthetics_monitor_verify_ssl = true # Response time alert condition will not be provisioned unless a critical violation threshold is specified. response_time_critical_threshold = 3 channel_ids = [data.newrelic_alert_channel.pager.id] } Copy Tip: Avoid resources being marked as \"sensitive\" When API results are deemed to be secret and are obfuscated, Terraform may be unable to detect the state of a resource, marking it as changed. Consider this example: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack\" { name = \"slack\" type = \"slack\" config { channel = \"test\" url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxx/xxxxx\" } } Copy Running terraform plan yields the following: -/+ newrelic_alert_channel.slack (new resource required) id: \"2344397\" => <computed> (forces new resource) config.%: \"1\" => \"2\" (forces new resource) config.channel: <sensitive> => <sensitive> (attribute changed) config.url: <sensitive> => <sensitive> (forces new resource) name: \"slack\" => \"slack\" type: \"slack\" => \"slack\" Copy To prevent Terraform from wrongly marking a resource as changed, add an ignore_changes directive: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack\" { ... lifecycle { ignore_changes = [\"config\"] } } ... Copy This avoids changes to resources caused by obfuscated items.",

Back to top icon Case Study CarRentals.com Drives Operational Excellence Through Continuous Measurement Using New Relic Contact sales INDUSTRY Travel LOCATION Bellevue, Wash. USE CASE System-wide monitoring of application and infrastructure performance, with analysis of long- and short-term trends PRODUCTS USED Insights Synthetics Infrastructure APM Browser WHY NEW RELIC Provides full-stack monitoring combined with powerful UI, visualization, and integration capabilities HIGHLIGHTS Achieved major savings by lowering costs associated with managing multiple monitoring tools Freed up three to four full-time employees to focus on strategic tasks Improved customer satisfaction and minimized revenue lost through customer abandonment Links Download PDF At its core, CarRentals.com is a technology brand within the Expedia Group. And it definitely takes a considerable amount of technological prowess to deliver the services that this online car rental booking company promises to customers and partners, features such as 60-second bookings and constantly updated inventory and pricing. To provide this consistently high level of service and innovation, CarRentals.com relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deliver its modernized cloud-based IT infrastructure, and on New Relic monitoring to achieve the full-stack visibility it needs to support scalable, reliable application delivery on top of that infrastructure.  Cultivating a culture of measurement One way that CarRentals.com’s IT organization has helped the company succeed in its goals has been by making operational excellence a part of its charter. Explains Craig Vandeputte, CarRentals.com’s director of DevOps, “To achieve operational excellence, we measure everything. Only in that way can we manage and improve everything.”  This kind of measurement is necessary to answer important questions about the effectiveness of its DevOps approach: Should there be a problem with an application, is the company the first to know about an issue rather than being alerted to it by customers? How quick is the team to fix those problems, and how fast can CarRentals.com get value to its customers? And while measuring everything is one thing, realizing the full value of all that measurement is quite another. With disparate monitoring tools, the organization lacked a unified way to visualize the performance of all its applications and infrastructure, limiting the IT team at CarRentals.com in extracting the full value of its software.  Like the Expedia Group overall, CarRentals.com has grown through acquisition. As a result, the company today supports two brands in addition to the flagship CarRentals.com: CarDelMar in Germany and the Netherlands, and Autoescape in France. Until recently, each brand was running a different monitoring solution. Each brand also had its own user interface (UI) supported by a common PHP-based monolithic backend. Recently, however, CarRentals.com started breaking up that backend into a set of microservices and moving those separate UIs to a common codebase. As the company began to consolidate its codebases, it also began looking to consolidate its monitoring tools with a solution that could be used across all three brands, and hook into Expedia Group’s Event Management Framework for incident management. A single tool for system-wide monitoring CarRentals.com found its solution in the New Relic platform. With CarDelMar already employing New Relic, the CarRentals.com IT team took a closer look at the monitoring solution and realized it provided precisely what the company needed. Says CarRentals.com brand CTO Garrett Vargas, “When we considered New Relic’s ability to surface problems not just at the UI layer but throughout our entire technology stack—as well as its tight integration with many of our development tools—it didn’t take long for us to agree on it as our one-stack solution.” Vandeputte joined the CarRentals.com team shortly after New Relic had been deployed, and he was pleasantly surprised by what he found. “In previous roles I’ve used a variety of home-grown, open-source solutions for monitoring,” he says. “When I was introduced to New Relic, I thought, holy cow, you have everything you need in one solution: synthetics to simulate user flows and behaviors, a beautiful UI, visualization mechanisms that are far more mature than anything I’d seen, and more.”  “When I was introduced to New Relic, I thought, holy cow, you have everything you need in one solution: synthetics to simulate user flows and behaviors, a beautiful UI, visualization mechanisms that are far more mature than anything I’d seen, and more.” Craig Vandeputte Director of DevOps for CarRentals.com The key to DevOps success By transitioning to microservices and delivering its IT infrastructure using AWS, CarRentals.com had already accelerated application development and gained the ability to scale globally. The addition of New Relic across all its brands has enabled CarRentals.com to raise the bar even higher. For the DevOps team, this has meant working with engineers from the company’s other three IT teams to identify key performance indicators (such as transactions per second, error rate, error count, success rate, and latencies) for each feature or update they’re working on. “Once the team has established what to measure and when to send out alerts, New Relic does the rest,” says Vandeputte. “As soon as an incident occurs—or an established threshold has been violated—an alert is sent to Expedia Group’s Event Management Framework, which escalates it to the correct team.”  Not surprisingly, this is invaluable to the DevOps team, which is able to deploy more quickly—and more confidently—as a result. Case in point: When a code change to the “Expedia Suggests Service” (which tries to resolve a user’s destination as they are typing it in) unintentionally transformed an optional field into a required one on the CarRentals.com site, New Relic sent out an alert, and within 20 minutes the Hamburg team had pushed out two releases and fixed the problem. It’s this kind of capability that helps CarRentals.com address those key performance questions mentioned earlier. In this instance, the company was the first to know there was an issue before its customers ever discovered it. Not only was the team able to fix the problem quickly, they now have the confidence to experiment with new features more often because they know they can spot and resolve issues immediately should they occur.   Instant insight into wide-ranging performance data While CTO Vargas appreciates the enormous value of this type of quick issue identification and resolution, what he likes best about having a unified monitoring platform is the New Relic Insights-created dashboards that enable him to analyze long- and short-term trends to his heart’s content. “Whether I want to look at site speed, purchase success rates, or any other metric we’ve deemed important, I can look at a dashboard that shows me day-by-day or hour-by-hour if performance is improving or degrading,” Vargas says. “This is hugely helpful.” Easing management, lowering costs, and delighting customers By deploying a suite of New Relic SaaS-based monitoring tools (including New Relic APM, New Relic Infrastructure, New Relic Synthetics, New Relic Browser, and New Relic Insights), CarRentals.com has not only gained a system-wide view of application and infrastructure performance, it has also achieved significant savings by lowering management costs. Vandeputte estimates that New Relic has enabled CarRentals.com to free up three to four full-time employees to focus on more strategic tasks. “In the past, I’ve seen teams spend 25% of their time either maintaining our monitoring solutions or developing new tools to monitor different areas,” Vandeputte says. “That work alone involved myriad subject matter experts working on a variety of platforms, which was hugely distracting and very expensive. With New Relic’s SaaS approach, we’re able to offload all of that burden.”  And it’s not just the IT team at CarRentals.com that’s benefiting from New Relic monitoring. Explains Vargas, “Even though we’re still in the early stages of integrating our New Relic dashboards into the Expedia Group network operations center, we’ve spent a considerable amount of time going over how we can better visualize the state of health across all of Expedia Group using New Relic. So far, people are very excited about what they’re seeing. New Relic dashboards are a welcome addition to our monitoring wall because they’re easier to read, everything is on one page, and they’re just a lot more mature than what is currently being used.” \"New Relic dashboards are a welcome addition to our monitoring wall because they’re easier to read, everything is on one page, and they’re just a lot more mature than what is currently being used.” Garrett Vargas CTO of CarRentals.com Most important, CarRentals.com is now able to constantly improve the digital customer experience. Says Vargas, “When customers aren’t able to retrieve or complete a booking, for example, we hear about it. So the faster we’re able to resolve an incident—or avoid an incident completely—the better feedback we get from customers.\"  Thus, with incidents being resolved significantly faster due to increased application health visibility, and error rates on the decline, customers are happier and the revenue lost through customer abandonment has dropped sharply. “With New Relic, we’re now able to dig deeper, so that when an incident does occur, we can usually pinpoint something that’s either not being measured or that needs better measurement, or identify new dependencies,” says Vargas. “As a result, we’re able to achieve our goal of being first to know of a problem, quick to fix it, and always improving—and that adds up to operational excellence.” Related Resources Case Study Phlexglobal Uses New Relic to Gain Visibility into Performance of Electronic Trial Master File Platform on Azure Cloud Solution Sheet Optimice su Eficiencia con Desarrollo Centrado en Datos Solution Sheet Otimize sua Eficiência com o Desenvolvimento Centrado em Dados White Paper Modernizing with AWS: Refactoring eBook The Enterprise Guide to Continuous Application Modernization Solution Sheet Mit datengestütztem DevOps schneller zum Erfolg Solution Sheet Allez plus vite avec une approche DevOps axée sur les données Solution Sheet Move Faster With Data-Driven DevOps COMPANY Careers and Culture Partner Program Investor Relations NewRelic.org Suppliers Portal CONNECT Contact Us Request Demo Events international newrelic.co.jp (Japanese) newrelic.fr (French) newrelic.de (German) Terms of Service DMCA Policy Privacy Policy Cookie Policy UK Slavery Act of 2015 ©2008-20 New Relic, Inc.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contributing to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Other apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Get started with the New Relic CLI 20 min Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal: you can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. Our CLI has been designed for automating common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic personal API Key, which you can create from the Account settings of your New Relic account An instrumented application in your New Relic account Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI The New Relic CLI can be downloaded via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile Now that you've installed the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Note that you need to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY -r YOUR_REGION # Set the profile as defaults newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 10 Get your application details In this example, you are going to add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 The New Relic CLI can retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application use the apm application search command. If you get an error, check that the account ID and application name you provided are correct. newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Copy Step 5 of 10 If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example. When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. [ { accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, applicationId: YOUR_APP_ID, domain: 'APM', entityType: 'APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY', guid: 'A_LONG_GUID', name: 'NAME_OF_YOUR_APP', permalink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID', reporting: true, type: 'APPLICATION', }, ]; Copy Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Let's suppose that you want to add an environment tag to your application. Go ahead and add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Copy Step 7 of 10 What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets come to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags at once to your application, modify and run the following snippet. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 You've created and added some tags to your application, but how do you know they're there? You need to retrieve your application's tags. To retrieve your application's tags, use the entity tags get command. newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: Create a deployment marker Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same Application ID from your earlier search. newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Copy Step 10 of 10 Notice that the JSON response includes the revision and timestamp of the deployment. This workflow could be built into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to help indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here is an example. { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands.

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us # Set the profile as default newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Copy Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Note Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. # Adding a single tag newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value # Adding multiple tags newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them.

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Create a \"Hello, World!\" application 15 min Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the NR1 VS Code extension to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: npm start Copy Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: nr1 nerdpack:publish Copy Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: nr1 create Copy Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: nr1 catalog:submit Copy Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack Manager role can subscribe accounts to an application. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it. Related information Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from `nr1`; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account, and to have Node.js installed on your machine. See [Setting up your development environment](/build-apps/set-up-dev-env) for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps*, and then in the Other apps section, you should see a Create a table** launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 2 Download the CLI and API key On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Step 2 of 2 Start building If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map.

Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "Add the NerdGraphQuery component to an application 20 minutes This guide steps you through the process of adding the `NerdGraphQuery` component to a sample transaction overview application. This allows you to query data from your New Relic account and add it to a dropdown menu. NerdGraph is our GraphQL implementation. GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST: The client, not the server, determines what data is returned. You can easily collect data from multiple sources. For example, in a single query, you can get account information, infrastructure data, and issue a NRQL request. Note Before completing this exercise, you can experiment with GraphQL queries in our NerdGraph API explorer. We also have a 14-minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of our CLI quick start, and be sure to make a copy of your account ID from step 1 because you’ll need it later. Note If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. Here's an example using HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Copy Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory use-nerdgraph-nerdlet: cd nr1-how-to/use-nerdgraph/nerdlets/use-nerdgraph-nerdlet Copy Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Note Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the /nr1-howto/use-nerdgraph directory: cd ../.. Copy Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), click Apps, and then click Use NerdGraph. After launching the Use NerdGraph application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your account: Add the NerdGraphQuery component Now you can create a dropdown menu for changing the account the application is viewing. The first step is to import the NerdGraphQuery component into the application's index.js file. Note If you need more details about our example below, see the APIs and components page on https://developer.newrelic.com Step 1 of 3 Add the NerdGraphQuery component into the first StackItem inside of the return in the index.js file: <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { console.log({ loading, error, data }); if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return null; }} </NerdGraphQuery>; Copy Step 2 of 3 The NerdGraphQuery component takes a query object that states the source you want to access and the data you want returned. Add the following code to your index.js file in the render method: Note In the browser console, you can see the data from your query returned in an object that follows the same structure of the object in the initial query. const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; Copy Step 3 of 3 To take the data returned by the NerdGraph query and display it in the application, replace the return null in the current NerdGraphQuery component with this return statement: return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; Copy When you go back to the browser and view your application, you see a new headline showing the name of your account returned from NerdGraph: How to use NerdGraphQuery.query At this point, you have implemented the NerdGraphQuery component with the application's render method and displayed the return data within the transaction overview application. Here's what you need to do next: Query NerdGraph inside of the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Save the returned data for later use in the application. Step 1 of 2 This code takes the response from NerdGraph and makes sure the results are processed, stored into the application state, and logged to the browser console for viewing. Add this code into the index.js file just under the constructor: componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({query: gql}) //The NerdGraphQuery.query method called with the query object to get your account data is stored in the accounts variable. accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } Copy Step 2 of 2 After the data is stored into state, display a selection so users can change accounts and update the application. To do this, add this code to index.js for the second StackItem in the return statement: { accounts && ( <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)} > {accounts.map((a) => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ); })} </Select> </StackItem> ); } Copy Review the results of the NerdGraph query After you complete these steps, look at the application in your browser, and note the following: The dropdown menu now displays the data returned from the NerdGraphQuery.query and allows you to select an account. After you select a new account, the application shows data from the new selection. The final index.js file should have code similar to the code below. This completed sample is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, HeadingText, Grid, GridItem, Stack, StackItem, Select, SelectItem, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart } from 'nr1' import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class UseNerdgraphNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.state = { accountId: <YOUR ACCOUNT ID>, accounts: null, selectedAccount: null, } } componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({ query: gql }) accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } selectAccount(option) { this.setState({ accountId: option.id, selectedAccount: option }); } render() { const { accountId, accounts, selectedAccount } = this.state; console.log({ accountId, accounts, selectedAccount }); const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; const variables = { id: accountId, }; const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <Stack fullWidth horizontalType={Stack.HORIZONTAL_TYPE.FILL} gapType={Stack.GAP_TYPE.EXTRA_LOOSE} spacingType={[Stack.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} directionType={Stack.DIRECTION_TYPE.VERTICAL}> <StackItem> <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({loading, error, data}) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </StackItem> {accounts && <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)}> {accounts.map(a => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ) })} </Select> </StackItem> } <StackItem> <hr /> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={trxOverview+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={avgResTime+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={responseCodes+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={errCount+since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </StackItem> </Stack> ) } } Copy Summary Now that you've completed all the steps in this example, you've successfully queried data from your account using the NerdGraphQuery component in two methods: Using the NerdGraphQuery component inside the application's render method and then passing the returned data into the children's components.

You can use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic entities. In this guide you'll learn how to set up New Relic for the first time with the official New Relic Kubernetes operator. More specifically, you'll provision an alert policy with NRQL conditions in your New Relic account using Kubernetes. Before you begin This walkthrough assumes you’ve already deployed a Kubernetes cluster. You could even create a local cluster on your machine with kind. To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Kubernetes. To complete the full exercise, you’ll need to: Deploy a New Relic agent if you haven't done so yet. Install New Relic for your application. Install kubectl and point it at the correct cluster; this determines the cluster where you’ll install the New Relic operator. Install kustomize. Step 1 of 3 Installing the operator on your Kubernetes cluster First, install cert-manager, which automatically provisions and manages TLS certificates in Kubernetes. kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.15.0/cert-manager.yaml Copy Next, install the Kubernetes operator. kustomize build https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-kubernetes-operator/config/default | kubectl apply -f - Copy To confirm the installation was successful, run a few kubectl commands to check the status of the Kubernetes operator. Ensure the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system, has been applied: kubectl get namespaces Copy The output should be similar to the following, which includes the Kubernetes operator's namespace, newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system: NAME STATUS AGE cert-manager Active 4m35s default Active 20m kube-node-lease Active 20m kube-public Active 20m kube-system Active 20m newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system Active 3m48s Copy Now, make sure the Kubernetes operator's controller manager is running: Note: Don't forget to include the --namespace (shorthand -n) option when running kubectl get pods to ensure you're inspecting resources within the correct namespace. kubectl get pods --namespace newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system Copy You should see output similar to the following: NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-7b9c64f58crwg9j 2/2 Running 0 157m Copy If your output is similar to the example shown, you’re ready for the next step. If you don’t see a pod named newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-<hash>, double check your Kubernetes configuration to ensure you’re within the correct context and pointing to the correct cluster. Step 2 of 3 Creating your first alert policy To kick things off, start small. First, create an alert policy with the minimum required configuration, then add a NRQL alert condition to the policy, which will add the condition to the policy in New Relic. A minimal alert policy configuration is represented in the code below. For the sake of this walkthrough, name this file new_relic_alert_policy.yaml. Note: For help locating your personal API key, check out New Relic's personal API key documentation. apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic personal API key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' Copy Now run the kubectl apply command to create your alert policy. kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml Copy You'll see output that reads similar to the following: alertspolicy.nr.k8s.newrelic.com/my-policy created Copy Confirm that your alert policy was created by viewing your policies at alerts.newrelic.com/accounts/{your account ID}/policies. You can search for your new policy by its name. In this case, search for \"Alert Policy Created With k8s.\" You should see your new alert policy. Next it’s time to add a NRQL alert condition to the policy using the same configuration file. Step 3 of 3 Add NRQL alert conditions to your alert policy In the previous section you created an alert policy; now, you’ll add some alert conditions to the policy so you can trigger alerts when certain metrics are out of line. In your new_relic_alert_policy.yaml file, add a NRQL alert condition to the policy that will alert you when an application's average overall response time is above five seconds for a three minute period. Note: To receive notifications when an alert is triggered, add notification channels to your alert policy, with this code. # The policy from the previous steps apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1 kind: AlertsPolicy metadata: name: my-policy spec: account_id: <your New Relic account ID> api_key: <your New Relic personal API key> name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename region: 'us' # Add a NRQL alert condition to the policy conditions: - spec: type: 'NRQL' name: 'NRQL Alert Condition Created With k8s' nrql: query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'YOUR APP NAME'\" evaluationOffset: 3 enabled: true terms: - threshold: '5' threshold_occurrences: 'ALL' threshold_duration: 180 priority: 'CRITICAL' operator: 'ABOVE' violationTimeLimit: 'ONE_HOUR' valueFunction: 'SINGLE_VALUE' Copy With the alert condition added to the configuration, you can apply the update, which will create a NRQL alert condition and add it to your policy. kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml Copy To confirm that the NRQL alert condition was created successfully, refresh your alert policy. If you see a new alert condition added to the alert policy, it was a success. To finish things off, you'll create and add an alert channel to your alert policy.

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... SELECT function(attribute) ... The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 1,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. You can specify a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a time zone for the query but not for the results. The returned results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 1:00 through 3:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Use automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Use max interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large interval can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Query metric data There are several ways to query metric data using NRQL: Query metric timeslice data, which is reported by New Relic APM, Mobile, Browser Query the Metric data type, which is reported by some of our integrations and Telemetry SDKs For more on understanding metrics in New Relic, see Metric data types. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Here are the available aggregator functions. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from complex metrics. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min gauge count, total, max, min, latest distribution count, total, max, min counter count Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]​) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 However, depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.

      "body": "You can create alert conditions using NRQL queries. Create NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL condition: When you start to create a condition, where it prompts you to Select a product, click NRQL. Tips on creating a NRQL condition: NRQL conditions Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For some condition types, you can create a Description. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Configure whether and how open violations are force-closed. Adjust the evaluation offset. Create a concise and descriptive condition name. (NerdGraph API Only) Provide a text description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Troubleshooting procedures Optional: To include your organization's procedures for handling the incident, add the runbook URL to the condition. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Offset the query time window Every minute, we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows. The start time depends on the value you select in the NRQL condition's Advanced settings > Evaluation offset. Example: Using the default time window to evaluate violations With the Evaluation offset at the default setting of three minutes, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend evaluating data from three minutes ago or longer. An offset of less than 3 minutes will trigger violations sooner, but you might see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Create a description You can define a description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by downstream systems.

      "body": "APM reports metric data in the form of metric timeslice data, and you can use NRQL to query and facet this type of data. Why query metric timeslice data? We report metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data we call metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile, and Browser (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Historically, this type of data couldn't be queried via our query language, NRQL. But now we are converting popular APM metrics from metric timeslice data to more-detailed dimensional metric data, which opens them up for querying via NRQL and via our NerdGraph API. This capability allows you to create powerful, in-depth custom visualizations of these important APM metrics. And this includes being able to query your custom metrics. Where to query? We recommend querying APM metric timeslice data using New Relic One query builder in advanced mode. This experience offers full NRQL functionality, and also gives helpful auto-complete suggestions and feedback on query errors. You can also incorporate NRQL queries in our NerdGraph (GraphQL) API. How to construct a query In APM, some charts have the option to view the NRQL query that generated that chart. This can be a good option for understanding how to query metrics. The NRQL query examined below is slightly modified from the error rate chart on the APM summary page. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') AND (transactionType = 'Web') SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES Here is a breakdown of how the parts of this query work: Query segment What does it do? FROM Metric Metric is one of our core data types, and metric timeslice data is stored as this data type. For general tips on querying Metric data, see Metric query examples. SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) This math generates a count of errors out of a total count of transaction metrics. This query uses the converted metric names. Note that you can use other aggregator functions. WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') You must specify at least one data source. You can select a single entity's GUID, as shown here, or you can select multiple sources. This query uses entity.guid, but you can also use appId or appName. AND (transactionType = 'Web') Sets the transaction type to web, meaning that background/non-web transactions won't be counted. SINCE 1 day ago Selecting a time range. TIMESERIES This optional clause displays the results in a time-based chart. For general information on NRQL syntax, including FROM, FACET, and TIMESERIES, see Intro to NRQL. For more queries, see Query examples. How metric timeslice data is converted The conversion of original APM metric timeslice metrics into dimensional metrics that are available for querying is an ongoing process and isn't complete. If you don't see a metric you're looking for in this section, see Generic queries. Here are how the original APM metric timeslice metrics are converted into dimensional metrics: Metric timeslice structure Dimensional metric structure APM metric names are represented as single strings of segments separated by forward slashes. For example, the “Datastore/statement/MySQL/users/select” metric represents the time spent in a select database operation on the users table. A single dimensional metric named apm.service.datastore.operation.duration represents the entire group of datastore metrics. This metric has three attributes representing the data values encoded into the metric name, datastoreType, table and operation: datastoreType = ‘MySQL’ table = ‘users’ operation = ‘select’ Some of the APM metrics made available as dimensional metrics: Metric name Description Attributes apm.service.cpu.usertime.utilization Time spent in user-mode code percentage apm.service.datastore.operation.duration Response time for database calls broken out by table operations datastoreType, table, operation apm.service.error.count Summary error count metrics transactionType apm.service.external.host.duration Response time for external calls broken out by external host name external.host apm.service.instance.count Count of the number of agent instances apm.service.memory.physical Process memory in MB apm.service.transaction.apdex Apdex scores per transaction transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.duration Response time per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.error.count Error counts per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.external.duration External call response time by transaction type transactionType To understand more about the general structure of metric timeslice data, including some common examples, see Metric timeslice data. Attributes These attributes are available in addition to the metric-specific attributes listed in the APM dimensional metrics table above. Name Description appName The name of the application. appId The ID of the application. entity.guid The GUID of the application. host The host of the monitored process. host.bootId The ID of the boot of the host, if available. host.displayName The display_name of the host, if it was set in the agent. instanceName For Java APM agents, host : port metricName The name of the dimensional metric. metricTimesliceName The timeslice name of the legacy metric. Generic queries with the newrelic.timeslice.value metric For metrics that haven't been converted to dimensional metrics, or for your own custom metrics, we have a dimensional metric named newrelic.timeslice.value. We recommend using the dimensional metrics from the table above when possible. When to use newrelic.timeslice.value? Given a metric timeslice name, you can query to see if it has a converted dimensional metric equivalent with this syntax: from Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) where metricTimesliceName = 'Datastore/statement/MySQL/test/select' If the only metric name returned is newrelic.timeslice.value, you'll need to query your data using this general approach. Facet on a wildcarded metric name segment Some metric timeslice names include attribute values as segments of the metric name. For example, our APM agents report metrics by tracking the duration of external calls using this format: External/{externalHost}/all Here, {externalHost} represents the host name for the outbound network call. Here's an example of a generic newrelic.timeslice.value query of a custom metric that facets on a wildcarded metric segment: FROM Metric SELECT count(newrelic.timeslice.value) WHERE appName = 'MY APP' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'Custom/Labels/{action}' TIMESERIES FACET action In this query, {action} creates a temporary attribute, action, which is then used by FACET action. You can use any name you want, because it's only an attribute that exists for the duration of the query. You should choose a name that does not conflict with an existing attribute name. Here's another example of a faceted wildcard query: This shows a NRQL query of metric timeslice data that facets the rate of Flask functions by the wildcarded process name. Recommended aggregator functions Recommended NRQL aggregator functions include: apdex average sum count rate uniques Query examples Some examples of querying metric timeslice data: Facet by multiple app names This query uses WHERE… IN to specify two applications and then facet by them: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Web throughput' WHERE appName IN ('MY_APPLICATION', 'MY_OTHER_APPLICATION') AND (transactionType = 'Web') FACET appName TIMESERIES Throughput-per-minute rate This query displays requests-per-minute chart using the rate function: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Facet by host-related attributes This query displays a requests-per-minute chart faceted by host name: FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 hours ago FACET host LIMIT 20 Instead of using host, you can facet by other host-related attributes, like host.bootId. Query of average duration of a metric This queries the average duration for a metric using average: FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher average duration' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.
