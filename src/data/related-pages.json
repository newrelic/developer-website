      "body": "The UI for the New Relic Android app provides functionality similar to the standard user interface, with customized details for mobile users. Pages The New Relic Android app includes: APM metrics, both real-time and historical data, including health maps. And, select the transaction icon for detailed transaction metrics, or an Overview Charts to view summary charts of your top five transactions. New Relic Infrastructure utilization. Mobile monitoring, including crash reports, network errors, API calls, and active user count. Select the filter icon to filter by labels and categories. Event notifications, including mobile alerts wherever you are, plus deployment notifications and notes. Note: New Relic's Android app does not have the full feature set of the New Relic web interface. For more detailed analysis, sign in to your New Relic account with a web browser. Time range When viewing an application or host, you can change the visible time frame by using the time picker icon in the top right of the page (the 7D in the screenshot). This feature is similar to the standard New Relic time picker. Features include: Scrub the New Relic charts to move back and forth in the timeline. Select the time picker to choose a time range that ends now (from 30 minutes to 90 days ago). New Relic Synthetics You can use the Android app to view your New Relic Synthetics data, including charts of your monitor's availability, load times, and load sizes. Select the caret icon to view more detailed charts. You can mute or disable your monitor, and view details of any recent errors. For scripted monitors, you can view and search the script log. Alerts When you log in to your New Relic account from the Android app, your device is automatically associated with your user channel. Then, you can add your user channel to your target policy to receive alerts. For Android alerts, notifications appear on your lock screen and can be viewed by tapping the alert. You can select any alert to view error details or acknowledge the alert. New Relic also sends a push notification when a colleague acknowledges an open event. Then, New Relic sends a final, closing notification when all Critical events end. Mobile apps If you have a mobile application and have installed mobile monitoring, you can monitor its performance directly from your Android device. Mobile monitoring includes network errors, API calls, and number of active users. You can also view detailed individual crash reports for a deeper understanding of a particular crash incident.",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add navigation to your nerdlet.",

      "body": "Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal. You can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. In short, you can use the CLI to automate common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic user key. An instrumented application in your New Relic account. Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI Download the New Relic CLI for your operating system, as described below. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Using Snapcraft, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Using Homebrew, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Using Scoop, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile. After you install the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. Run the profiles add command: bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add --profile tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default --profile tutorial Important You must set the region of your New Relic account. Use -r to set either us or eu. Step 3 of 10 Get your application details. Now, add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 Retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application, use the apm application search command: bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Tip If you get an error, check that your account ID and application name are correct. Step 5 of 10 Find the guid value. If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example: [ { \"accountId\": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, \"applicationId\": YOUR_APP_ID, \"domain\": \"APM\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"A_LONG_GUID\", \"name\": \"NAME_OF_YOUR_APP\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" } ] Copy When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application. Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Here, you add an environment tag to your application. Add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 Add tag sets. What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags to your application at once, modify and run this snippet: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 Retrieve your application's tags. You've created and added some tags to your application, but to test that they're working, you need to retrieve them. Run the entity tags get command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array: [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: create a deployment marker. Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same application ID from your earlier search: bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Check the JSON response for the revision and timestamp of the deployment. You can build this workflow into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here's an example: { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands in the New Relic CLI. For example, you can create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel",

      "body": "You can use the New Relic NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to make New Relic Query Language (NRQL) queries. To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. NRQL queries made through NerdGraph are subject to NRQL Query Rate Limits. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction.

      "body": "For some New Relic solutions, one way to report custom data to New Relic is to use custom attributes. For example, for New Relic browser monitoring, you might create a custom attribute to track the user name associated with a slow or failing request. Requirements Custom attributes are available for these New Relic solutions: APM Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Infrastructure monitoring For other custom data solutions, see Intro to custom data. APM: Record custom attributes Important Review the list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Using reserved terms can cause issues. To enable and use custom attributes for APM, follow the procedure for your APM agent: C SDK To add custom attributes to applications monitored by the C SDK, call one of the attribute functions; for example, newrelic_add_attribute_double(). The key name for your custom attribute depends on what you specify when you call the function. Go Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Go agent. However, you can disable custom attribute collection. Java Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Java. You can collect custom attributes using XML and the Java agent APIs. These two methods can be used in conjunction with each other. Method How to do it Specify attributes in XML XML allows you to specify custom attributes without changing any of your source code. You can have multiple XML files for custom attributes that are grouped by some logical facet. To set custom attributes for your Java app via XML: Review the New Relic Java agent's documentation about XML file format, methods and classes, and examples. From your Extensions directory within the New Relic Java agent, create a single XML file. Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor by editing your XML file directly. Define an XML instrumentation file using the New Relic UI. This may require additional config in the common: block of your newrelic.yml. See Report custom attributes under Instrumentation options for more detail. Call the agent's API Example 1: Adding custom attributes to transactions To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each method you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with attributes.include and attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId, include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); Copy Example 2: Adding custom attributes to spans in distributed traces To collect custom attributes using the agent's API, call the relevant methods: For each span (currently executing method) that you want to record an attribute for, call NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...). Optional: Include or exclude certain attributes with span_events.attributes.include and span_events.attributes.exclude. For example, to record a variable named userId on the current span, include this code in the associated method: NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(\"userId\", userId); Copy Collect user attributes The Java agent also includes a built-in mechanism to enable user attributes and collect user information from HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() as custom attributes. .NET Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in .NET. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For each method for which you want to record an attribute, call AddCustomAttribute. Optional: Include or exclude attributes with the include and exclude configuration options. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (number), you could include this code in the parent method: IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction .AddCustomAttribute(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"Item Code\", 31456); Copy Node.js Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Node.js. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method: For each attribute you want to record, call newrelic.addCustomAttribute. To record multiple attributes using a single call, use newrelic.addCustomAttributes. For example, to record attributes for a coupon code and an item ID code, you could include this in the parent method: newrelic.addCustomAttributes({ \"Discount Code\": \"Summer Super Sale\", \"Item Code\": 31456 }); Copy PHP Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in PHP. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API method for each method that you want to record an attribute; newrelic_add_custom_parameter for transaction events and spans newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter for only spans For example, to record a variable named $userId, include this code in the parent method: newrelic_add_custom_parameter ('userID', $userId) Copy Python Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Python. To collect custom attributes, call add_custom_parameter for each method that you want to record an attribute. For example, to record a variable named user_id, include this code in the parent method: newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameter('user_id', user_id) Copy Ruby Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in Ruby. To collect custom attributes, call the relevant API methods: For Ruby agent version 3.12.0 or higher, use the add_custom_attributes method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy For Ruby agent version 3.11.2 or lower, use the add_custom_parameters method. For example, to record a variable named @user_id, include this code in the parent method: ::NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_parameters({ user_id: @user.id }) Copy Browser monitoring: Record custom attributes The browser agent provides an API to specify extra details associated with a page view or browser interaction, either by forwarding attributes from APM to browser monitoring or by specifying custom attributes through JavaScript. Values forwarded from the APM agent are encoded and injected into browser attributes by our browser agent. Infrastructure monitoring: Record custom attributes Our Infrastructure monitoring lets you create custom attributes that are used to annotate the data from the infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. Mobile monitoring: Record custom attributes Mobile agents include API calls to record custom attributes: For an overview of mobile monitoring custom data, see Insert custom events and attributes Android method: setAttribute iOS method: setAttribute",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline.

The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "CodeStream and New Relic work together in several ways to give you insight into your code's errors, as well as making it easier to get started instrumenting your code with our APM agents. Specifically, when CodeStream is connected to New Relic, you can jump from a stack trace error in the New Relic UI directly to the offending line of code in your IDE. Once in your IDE, you can navigate the stack trace and collaborate with your teammates to resolve the issue. Preview release CodeStream's integration with New Relic One is a preview release limited to New Relic One accounts on our US data center, and your use is subject to the pre-release policy. (This does not apply to all other CodeStream functionality.) Connect CodeStream and New Relic Before you can take advantage of New Relic's observability features in CodeStream, you'll need to connect them. Requirements for connecting CodeStream and New Relic: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key If you don't have a user key or want to learn more about how you can use and manage them, see our doc on the New Relic user key. Once you have your New Relic user key, in CodeStream's Observability section click Connect to New Relic One, then paste your API key and click Connect to New Relic One. Caution New Relic users can share stacktrace errors on CodeStream. Once you've connected CodeStream to New Relic, any new users you add to your CodeStream organization can see those errors. See your errors and what's causing them After you connect CodeStream and New Relic, use workloads and errors inbox to jump to the offending code in your IDE. Requirements for opening stack trace errors in your IDE: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection Data being reported to New Relic via APM monitoring A workload for errors inbox An error For APM errors, your repository's commit hash and release tag New Relic errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, prioritize, and take action on your errors before they impact customers. With CodeStream, you can jump from an error directly to the offending code in your IDE. Tip Limited to APM errors. How to go from errors inbox to your IDE From one.newrelic.com/, go to Errors Inbox, click a stack trace error, then click Open in IDE. APM errors and CodeStream In order to view stack trace errors in your IDE, CodeStream needs to know what repository the error is associated with and, ideally, which version of the code generated the error. Associate repositories with errors Once you've started monitoring for APM, mobile, browser, or Lambda, you should create repository entities and associate them with entities for all of your services. In order to create a repository entity you'll need to provide the repository's remote URL. For example, the remote URL can be in either the SSH or HTTPS format: git@github.com:newrelic/beta-docs-site.git https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git Caution It's possible to add the same GitHub repository more than once, if you're using different protocols to do so. The UI warns you about this, but won't prevent you from doing so. For example, https://github.com/tuna/repo and git@github.com:tuna/repo are the same repo, with different protocols. If you try to open an error in your IDE and there isn't an associated repository, CodeStream will prompt you to make an association and save that association for all errors from the given entity on New Relic. However, it would be preferably to use one of the following methods since they require less ongoing manual effort and eliminate the possibility of end-user mistakes, such as misconfigured remote URLs. Use environment variable with APM (recommended) Set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_METADATA_REPOSITORY_URL. New Relic APM agents create the repository entity and associate it to your application entity automatically. This requires the SSH or HTTPS URL format. We recommend that these be set as part of your build pipeline. Use the UI Once you've started sending data to New Relic, use the UI to connect your related repository. Go to the APM Summary page via one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app), then look for the Repositories section at the bottom-right. Click Connect repository to find an existing repository or add a new one. Use the NerdGraph API Use New Relic's NerdGraph APIsto create a repository and associate it with your application entities. Step 1: Create a repository entity To create a repository entity, use the referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository API and make sure to save the GUID that's produced. The API takes the following parameters: accountId - the integer account ID for the account you want to add the repository to url - example https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git name - example: newrelic/beta-docs-site mutation { referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository(repositories: [{accountId: [YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID], name: \"[REPO_NAME]\", url: \"[REPO_URL]\"}]) { created failures { guid message type } } } Copy In order to find the entity you create, you can use a query like the following. Note that the URL you provided to referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository gets saved as an entity tag. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name = 'a name' OR tags.url = 'a url'\") { count query results { entities { guid name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Step 2: Associate the repository entity to your application entity First, find the GUID for the application you want to associate your repository to. Parameters: sourceEntityGuid - the entity GUID of the application targetEntityGuid - the entity GUID of your repository type - always BUILT_FROM mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace(sourceEntityGuid: \"\", targetEntityGuid: \"\", type: BUILT_FROM) { errors { message type } } } Copy To see all entities related to your repository you can do a query like this: { actor { entity(guid: \"[YOUR_REPOSITORY_GUID]]\") { relatedEntities(filter: {direction: BOTH, relationshipTypes: {include: BUILT_FROM}}) { results { target { entity { name guid type } } type } } name type tags { values key } } } } Copy Step 3: Cleanup (if needed) Delete a repository with the following query: mutation DeleteRepository { entityDelete(guids: \"[ENTITY_GUID_HERE]]\") { deletedEntities failures { message guid } } } Copy Associate build SHAs or release tags with errors To use CodeStream's Open in IDE with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. CodeStream only needs the first seven characters of your commit sha (for example, 734713b) to make this connection, but you can include the entire sha. Alternately, you can use a release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209) for CodeStream to find the correct version of your code. For New Relic APM, the commit and/or release tag (tags.commit and tags.releaseTag) are added as attributes on Transaction and TransactionError events. You can use APM environment variables to set these attributes. We recommend setting one or both of these variables as part of your build pipeline. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_COMMIT - The commit sha. You can include the whole thing or only the first seven characters. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_RELEASE_TAG - A release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209). This has the advantage of being human readable. For more on how to set these variables, here are specific configuration details for each language: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Install APM agents with CodeStream Requirements for installing New Relic APM agents via CodeStream: New Relic account New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection A supported language application codebase .NET Core Java Node.JS When you first connect CodeStream to New Relic, if you're working on an application's codebase that's not being monitored by New Relic, CodeStream will offer to instrument that application for you. Like New Relic's guided install, CodeStream will walk you through and automate all of the steps to installing the APM agent to start sending data to New Relic. This check only happens automatically when the initial connection is made. To do so later, in the CodeStream extension, click your username, then click New Relic Setup.

      "body": "What is MLOps? MLOps stands for machine-learning operations. As more companies invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there's a gap in understanding between the data science teams developing machine-learning models and the DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models. MLOps provides a tool for monitoring and observing the performance and effectiveness of machine-learning models in a production environment. This increases the possibilities for collaboration between data science and DevOps teams, feeding into a continuous process of development, testing, and operational monitoring. The Datarobot integration Datarobot provides tools for deploying your machine-learning models into production. By integrating, Datarobot's integration with New Relic, you'll be able to instrument, analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your machine-learning performance across your entire system. By rigorously observing your capabilities, you'll be able to react quickly to changes in the model's input or output and the relationship between the two. Send your model performance metrics from Datarobot Insights to New Relic and you'll have real-time monitoring for your algorithms. You'll explore your metrics data with user-friendly charts and learn the state of your algorithms at a glance for faster and more efficient troubleshooting. Integrate Datarobot with New Relic First, Datarobot uses a Kafka topic to stream Insights from your machine-learning algorithm's performance metrics. Then, the New Relic connector (another algorithm) transforms the Kafka topic into a metrics data payload for a specific New Relic account. Datarobot uses Kafka and Event Flows to send data to New Relic. With Datarobot’s Event Flows, when a new message is set to your Kafka topic, your configured New Relic connector algorithm gets called. The connector transforms your metrics and sends them to your New Relic account. Connect your Datarobot data to New Relic By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Datarobot machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. Start monitoring your Datarobot event flows with New Relic.

Overview This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. Note that this is only one way to add tags. For other methods, see How tags are added. For how to automate tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. For APM agents, a restart is required after adding a new tag. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. For APM agents, a restart is required after changing tags. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "CodeStream and New Relic work together in several ways to give you insight into your code's errors, as well as making it easier to get started instrumenting your code with our APM agents. Specifically, when CodeStream is connected to New Relic, you can jump from a stack trace error in the New Relic UI directly to the offending line of code in your IDE. Once in your IDE, you can navigate the stack trace and collaborate with your teammates to resolve the issue. Preview release CodeStream's integration with New Relic One is a preview release limited to New Relic One accounts on our US data center, and your use is subject to the pre-release policy. (This does not apply to all other CodeStream functionality.) Connect CodeStream and New Relic Before you can take advantage of New Relic's observability features in CodeStream, you'll need to connect them. Requirements for connecting CodeStream and New Relic: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key If you don't have a user key or want to learn more about how you can use and manage them, see our doc on the New Relic user key. Once you have your New Relic user key, in CodeStream's Observability section click Connect to New Relic One, then paste your API key and click Connect to New Relic One. Caution New Relic users can share stacktrace errors on CodeStream. Once you've connected CodeStream to New Relic, any new users you add to your CodeStream organization can see those errors. See your errors and what's causing them After you connect CodeStream and New Relic, use workloads and errors inbox to jump to the offending code in your IDE. Requirements for opening stack trace errors in your IDE: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection Data being reported to New Relic via APM monitoring A workload for errors inbox An error For APM errors, your repository's commit hash and release tag New Relic errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, prioritize, and take action on your errors before they impact customers. With CodeStream, you can jump from an error directly to the offending code in your IDE. Tip Limited to APM errors. How to go from errors inbox to your IDE From one.newrelic.com/, go to Errors Inbox, click a stack trace error, then click Open in IDE. APM errors and CodeStream In order to view stack trace errors in your IDE, CodeStream needs to know what repository the error is associated with and, ideally, which version of the code generated the error. Associate repositories with errors Once you've started monitoring for APM, mobile, browser, or Lambda, you should create repository entities and associate them with entities for all of your services. In order to create a repository entity you'll need to provide the repository's remote URL. For example, the remote URL can be in either the SSH or HTTPS format: git@github.com:newrelic/beta-docs-site.git https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git Caution It's possible to add the same GitHub repository more than once, if you're using different protocols to do so. The UI warns you about this, but won't prevent you from doing so. For example, https://github.com/tuna/repo and git@github.com:tuna/repo are the same repo, with different protocols. If you try to open an error in your IDE and there isn't an associated repository, CodeStream will prompt you to make an association and save that association for all errors from the given entity on New Relic. However, it would be preferably to use one of the following methods since they require less ongoing manual effort and eliminate the possibility of end-user mistakes, such as misconfigured remote URLs. Use environment variable with APM (recommended) Set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_METADATA_REPOSITORY_URL. New Relic APM agents create the repository entity and associate it to your application entity automatically. This requires the SSH or HTTPS URL format. We recommend that these be set as part of your build pipeline. Use the UI Once you've started sending data to New Relic, use the UI to connect your related repository. Go to the APM Summary page via one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app), then look for the Repositories section at the bottom-right. Click Connect repository to find an existing repository or add a new one. Use the NerdGraph API Use New Relic's NerdGraph APIsto create a repository and associate it with your application entities. Step 1: Create a repository entity To create a repository entity, use the referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository API and make sure to save the GUID that's produced. The API takes the following parameters: accountId - the integer account ID for the account you want to add the repository to url - example https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git name - example: newrelic/beta-docs-site mutation { referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository(repositories: [{accountId: [YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID], name: \"[REPO_NAME]\", url: \"[REPO_URL]\"}]) { created failures { guid message type } } } Copy In order to find the entity you create, you can use a query like the following. Note that the URL you provided to referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository gets saved as an entity tag. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name = 'a name' OR tags.url = 'a url'\") { count query results { entities { guid name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Step 2: Associate the repository entity to your application entity First, find the GUID for the application you want to associate your repository to. Parameters: sourceEntityGuid - the entity GUID of the application targetEntityGuid - the entity GUID of your repository type - always BUILT_FROM mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace(sourceEntityGuid: \"\", targetEntityGuid: \"\", type: BUILT_FROM) { errors { message type } } } Copy To see all entities related to your repository you can do a query like this: { actor { entity(guid: \"[YOUR_REPOSITORY_GUID]]\") { relatedEntities(filter: {direction: BOTH, relationshipTypes: {include: BUILT_FROM}}) { results { target { entity { name guid type } } type } } name type tags { values key } } } } Copy Step 3: Cleanup (if needed) Delete a repository with the following query: mutation DeleteRepository { entityDelete(guids: \"[ENTITY_GUID_HERE]]\") { deletedEntities failures { message guid } } } Copy Associate build SHAs or release tags with errors To use CodeStream's Open in IDE with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. CodeStream only needs the first seven characters of your commit sha (for example, 734713b) to make this connection, but you can include the entire sha. Alternately, you can use a release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209) for CodeStream to find the correct version of your code. For New Relic APM, the commit and/or release tag (tags.commit and tags.releaseTag) are added as attributes on Transaction and TransactionError events. You can use APM environment variables to set these attributes. We recommend setting one or both of these variables as part of your build pipeline. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_COMMIT - The commit sha. You can include the whole thing or only the first seven characters. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_RELEASE_TAG - A release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209). This has the advantage of being human readable. For more on how to set these variables, here are specific configuration details for each language: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Install APM agents with CodeStream Requirements for installing New Relic APM agents via CodeStream: New Relic account New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection A supported language application codebase .NET Core Java Node.JS When you first connect CodeStream to New Relic, if you're working on an application's codebase that's not being monitored by New Relic, CodeStream will offer to instrument that application for you. Like New Relic's guided install, CodeStream will walk you through and automate all of the steps to installing the APM agent to start sending data to New Relic. This check only happens automatically when the initial connection is made. To do so later, in the CodeStream extension, click your username, then click New Relic Setup.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API.",

Troubleshoot data ingest with NrIntegrationError Our NrIntegrationError event is used to capture issues related to: Exceeding of our data ingest limits Exceeding of our query limits Malformed data Configuration issues You can run NRQL queries to analyze NrIntegrationError error messages. You can also set up alerts to be notified when specific types of errors, or certain quantities of errors, occur. NrIntegrationError events are primarily categorized by the feature that is sending them, as indicated by the newRelicFeature attribute. Values include: Metrics indicates an issue with Metric API ingest. Event API indicates an issue with Event API ingest. Logs indicates an issue with logs ingest. Distributed Tracing indicates an issue with distributed tracing (Span) data. For attribute definitions, see the data dictionary. Query and alert You can query NrIntegrationError events using NRQL, and set up NRQL alert conditions to get notified when issues happen. Here are some examples of queries: Query of Event API issues Here's a simple query of NrIntegrationError. This one shows Event API ingest issues from the last week, with up to 100 results: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100 Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries.

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status.

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. Here we explain how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and give an example of deploying a Go app with Docker. Important The Go agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the Go agent, building a custom Go runtime for Docker, and deploying a golang application. For more information about deploying and configuring your Go app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Go Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Go app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Go agent for your specific app server, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Go to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, download and install git, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example code defines the golang version used. FROM golang:1.8-onbuild CMD go run main.go Copy 4. Build a Docker image To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5.

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "New Relic products report a lot of data “out of the box.” When you use products like APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure monitoring, or an integration, by default you receive performance data. But you may want to bring data into New Relic that isn't collected by default. Maybe you want an API-based solution that doesn't require install of an agent. Maybe you want to bring telemetry data from another analysis service into New Relic. This page describes several ways to get data into New Relic. Step 1 of 6 Agent APIs If you use our APM, Browser, or Mobile agents to report data, you can use their associated APIs to report custom data. For example, if you monitor your application with our APM Python agent, you can use the Python agent API to set up custom instrumentation. See the agent APIs. Step 2 of 6 Telemetry SDK Our Telemetry SDKs are language wrappers for our Trace API and Metric API (and eventually our Log API and Event API). These SDKs let you easily send metrics and trace data to New Relic without needing to install an agent. For customers, we offer open-source exporters and integrations that use the Telemetry SDKs to send metrics and trace data: Istio adaptor Prometheus OpenMetrics (for Docker | for Kubernetes) OpenCensus exporter (for Go | for Python) DropWizard exporter Micrometer exporter Want to build your own solution? See our Telemetry SDK docs. Step 3 of 6 Trace API Our Trace API lets you send distributed tracing data to New Relic and consolidate tracing data from multiple sources in one place. We accept trace data in two formats: Zipkin format New Relic format (if you don’t have Zipkin-format data, you’d use this) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $LICENSE_KEY\" \\ > -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ > -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"common\": { $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host123.test.com\" $ } $ }, $ \"spans\": [ $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"ABC\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"duration.ms\": 12.53, $ \"name\": \"/home\" $ } $ }, $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"DEF\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", $ \"duration.ms\": 2.97, $ \"name\": \"/auth\", $ \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 4 of 6 Metric API You can use our Metric API to send metric data to New Relic from any source. bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $LICENSE_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"metrics\": [ $ { $ \"name\": \"memory.heap\", $ \"type\": \"gauge\", $ \"value\": 2.3, $ \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, $ \"attributes\": { $ \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 5 of 6 Event API For sending arbitrary events to New Relic, you can use our Event API.

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. NRQL queries made through NerdGraph are subject to NRQL Query Rate Limits. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API.",

      "info": "Use NerdGraph to query your existing alert configurations, and add those configurations to your quickstart.",
      "body": "With a quickstart, you let your users quickly install dashboards, alerts, and other resources. Here, you learn how to use New Relic's GraphQL API, NerdGraph, to query your existing alert conditions and configure them in your quickstart. Important This guide assumes you already have alerts in your New Relic account and a quickstart that you want to add those alerts to. If you don't already have a quickstart, follow our lab to learn how to build one. Set up your quickstart's alerts directory This guide assumes you have a quickstart. However, your quickstart may or may not already have alerts. Either way, to add alerts to your quickstart, you need an alerts directory. If your quickstart already has one, you can skip this section. The _template directory of New Relic One quickstarts contains an alerts template folder. Copy this folder to your quickstart. From here, you use the YAML file that corresponds to the alert condition type you want to add to your quickstart. Once your quickstart is ready to add alerts, you need to look up your alert condition's ID. Look up your alert's condition ID To populate your alert configurations with NerdGraph, you first need to look up its identifier. Step 1 of 5 From your New Relic homepage, go to Alerts & AI. Step 2 of 5 Click Policies in left hand navigation. Step 3 of 5 Choose your policy from the list. Step 4 of 5 Here, you see the list of conditions. Choose the condition that you want to query. Step 5 of 5 On the Next page, you see ID, Account, and Policy associated with the condition. Copy the ID. With this identifier, you can now query your alert conditions and use the response to build out alert resources in your quickstart. Query alert conditions in NerdGraph There are three types of alerts you can have in New Relic: Static Baseline Outlier Jump to the appropriate section for the kind of alert you want to add to your quickstart. Query your static alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name type nrql { query } valueFunction terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlStaticCondition for your condition's ID, name, query and more. These are the required fields you need to create the same alert in your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get a JSON representation of the specified condition. Next, use this response to add a static alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane. Step 4 of 4 Populate static-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Static Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the host count is < 2. # Type of alert type: STATIC # NRQL query nrql: query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction\" # Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE) valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Operator used to compare against the threshold. operator: BELOW # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a static alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your baseline alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { id name nrql { query } baselineDirection terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition for your condition's name, query, baselineDirection, and other fields required to add the condition to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data of your alert. Next, use this response to add baseline alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane. Step 4 of 4 Populate baseline-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Baseline Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the average Transaction duration deviates 2 standard deviations from the normal. # Type of alert type: BASELINE # NRQL query nrql: # Baseline alerts can use an optional FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" # Direction in which baseline is set (Default: LOWER_ONLY) baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600, must be a multiple of 60 for Baseline conditions thresholdDuration: 180 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a baseline alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your outlier alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { id name nrql { query } expectedGroups terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition for required fields to add an outlier alert to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data for your alert condition. Next, use this response to add a outlier alert to your quickstart. Step 4 of 4 Populate outlier-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Outlier Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered when any facet(s) deviate from the center of the group for at least 5 mins # Type of alert type: OUTLIER # NRQL query nrql: # Outlier alerts require FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET http.statusCode\" # Number of groups expected in the returned values for the condition (Default: 2) expectedGroups: 4 # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 1 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 2592000 Copy Here, you added an outlier alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "With secrets management, you can configure the agent and on-host integrations to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the configuration files. Currently, Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS, CyberArk, and New Relic CLI obfuscation are supported. Define secrets To use secrets in a configuration YAML file: Define a variables section, where each entry is a name for a secret object. In each entry, include the source of the secret and the proper configuration to retrieve those secrets. In the general configuration section, set ${variable.property} placeholders that will be automatically replaced by the properties of the secret object. The secret object can be defined as a simple string or json object. Important If the secrets retrieval fails, the integration won't be executed, as the infrastructure agent does not have all the data it requires to execute. For example, the following configuration will retrieve an object named creds from Vault (you can define the object's name for the secret.) Let's assume that the stored object is a valid JSON with a property named user and another property named password. We want to use them to set the basic HTTP credentials of the status_url property from an Nginx on-host integration: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Tip Both simple strings and valid JSON objects can be retrieved from variables. When using JSON objects make sure both keys and values are enclosed with double-quotes. Using environment variables Environment variables can be used into the variables section with the {{MY_ENV_VAR}} notation. When doing so, environment variables are expanded and their value is replaced at runtime. Use this method to avoid having sensitive values such as tokens or obfuscation keys included in the configuration file. When using environment variables in on-host integration configuration files the passthrough_environment setting must be defined. Secrets variables Define secrets in each configuration under a variables section. Each entry is a user-defined secret name that will store the properties of the retrieved secrets. Each variable can contain the following properties: YAML key Description ttl Type: String Amount of time before a secret is refreshed. This can be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h). Examples: 30s, 10m, 1h Default: 1h aws-kms AWS KMS secret retrieval configuration vault Vault secret retrieval configuration cyberark-cli CyberArk command line interface configuration cyberark-api CyberArk REST API configuration obfuscated New Relic CLI obfuscation AWS KMS secrets To retrieve your secrets from Amazon KMS, you can set the following properties in your aws-kms section. Not all fields are required. For example, you will need either data, file, or http to provide the encoded KMS string. YAML key Description data Type: String Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt file Type: String Path to file containing Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt http Type: YAML properties HTTP configuration to use to request Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt. For more information, see Vault http. credential_file Type: String Path to AWS credentials file config_file Type: String Path to AWS config file region Type: String AWS KMS region type Type: String (plain, equal, or json) Secret value format: plain: a raw string to be stored directly into the destination variable. equal: a key=property one-line string to be stored as object properties into the destination variable. json: a JSON object to be stored as properties into the destination variable. Secrets of type plain or json use dot notation; for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. The following example will allow retrieving a plain password string from AWS KMS. It must be decrypted from the provided data encoded string. variables: myPassword: aws-kms: data: T0hBSStGTEVY region: ap-southeast-2 credential_file: \"./my-aws-credentials-file\" config_file: \"./my-aws-config-file\" type: plain Copy Vault secrets Vault must enable an http field containing the HTTP configuration used to connect to Vault. The http entry can contain the following entries: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers tls_config properties Important Secrets must use dot notation, for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. YAML key Description enable Type: Boolean Enable TLS Default: false insecure_skip_verify Type: Boolean Skip verifying server’s certificate chain and host Default: false min_version Type: UInt16 The minimum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.0) max_version Type: UInt16 The maximum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.3) ca Type: String TLS certificate \"\" The following example will retrieve a secret using a Vault token from a secured server, and skip the server certificates verification: variables: mydata: vault: http: url: https://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy CyberArk command line interface To retrieve secrets from the CyberArk command line interface (CLI) use the following configuration, all keys are required YAML Key Description cli Type: string Full path to the CyberArk CLI executable Default: \"\" app-id Type: string Application id of the secret holder Default: \"\" safe Type: string Safe containing the secret Default: \"\" folder Type: string Folder containing the secret Default: \"\" object Type: string The object the secret is associated with Default: \"\" The following example will retrieve a CyberArk secret using the command line interface: variables: credentials: cyberark-cli: cli: /full/path/to/clipasswordsdk app-id: my-appid safe: my-safe folder: my-folder object: my-object Copy CyberArk REST API To retrieve secrets using the CyberArk REST API there must be a http key containing the HTTP configuration. The http key contains these sub-keys, only url is required: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from, this key is required Default: none tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers The following example will retrieve a secret using the CyberArk REST API, skipping server certificate verification: variables: credentials: cyberark-api: http: url: https://hostname/AIMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=myAppID&Query=Safe=mySafe;Object=myObject tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy New Relic CLI Obfuscation Important We recommend using any of the supported secrets providers instead of the simple obfuscation when possible. See our guidelines below to define environment variables to avoid having the obfuscation key in configuration files. Tip Infrastructure Agent 1.14.0 or above is required You can use the New Relic CLI obfuscate command to obscure sensitive information in the infrastructure agent or any on-host integration configuration file. Steps: Install the New Relic CLI on any host (it can be your development host). Run the CLI obfuscate command in order to generate the obfuscated value: newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '<plain_text_config_value>' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy Copy the result of the cli command into the text argument in the obfuscated section as shown in the examples below. You can obfuscate JSON blocks if you need to reference multiple values in your configuration YML file. Note that you may need to escape the quotation marks \"\" with backslashes on Windows hosts. For example: '{\\\"attribute\\\":\\\"value\\\".... In addition, use Powershell on Windows hosts, rather than the Command Prompt window, since the Command Prompt window can handle quotation marks in unexpected ways. newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '{\"attribute\":\"value\", \"attribute2\":\"value2\"}' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy YAML key Description key Type: String The string used when obfuscating the clear-text value using New Relic CLI Default: none secret Type: String The output of the newrelic-cli command Default: none Integrations configuration example The following example will allow retrieving the Nginx user and password that has been obfuscated using the New Relic CLI. This example uses dot notation when retrieving the credentials, since the obfuscated value was a JSON block: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy It's recommended to use environment variables for the obfuscation arguments as shown in the example below: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: {{OBFUSCATION_KEY}} secret: {{OBFUSCATION_TEXT}} instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy Agent configuration example This example allows retrieving a string that contains the proxy details (user, password and host): variables: obfuscated_proxy: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' proxy: ${obfuscated_proxy} Copy",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

If left empty, make sure you pass title so that users get a reference about the data the column shows. classNamestring Appends class names to the component. onClickfunction Callback fired any time the user clicks on the header. When clicked, sorting information (and the next sorting state) will be passed as the second parameter. Use it rather than computing it yourself. function ( event : React.MouseEvent, sortingData : Object ) sortableboolean DEFAULT false Whether the column is sortable. This means that the up and down arrows will be shown, side to the heading text. Sorting is a controlled component interface, you are in charge of listening for the sorting event and applying the sorting to the corresponding column, by changing its sortingOrder prop. sortingFunctionfunction Method for sorting rows. The default method will usually do the right thing (alphabetical ordering for text, numerical ordering for numbers and boolean grouping), but if needed this can be overridden. The function takes two parameters (a and b) and has to return a negative number if a is considered to appear before b, a positive one if it's considered to appear after, and zero if both values are identical. Each of the objects passed to the callback contains the value for the given row (i.e. the result of calling value over the row), the row item (as item), the index of the row (as index) and all the items in the items array (as items). Generally you will compare rows using a.item and b.item. function ( a : object, b : object ) => number sortingOrdernumber DEFAULT Number . MAX_SAFE_INTEGER Establishes the sorting order. A lowest number indicates a highest sorting priority, meaning that 0 will be the first column sorted, and if two items are identical, we will use column 1 and so on. Columns that do not have an explicit sorting order are used after all columns that do have it, and they are applied in order of appearance. sortingTypeenum DEFAULT TableHeaderCell . SORTING_TYPE . NONE Establishes the sorting for the column. Columns are sorted based on the element returned by the value prop. <One of TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.ASCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.DESCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.NONE , > styleobject Inline style for custom styling. testIdstring Adds a data-test-id attribute. Use it to target the component in unit and E2E tests. Note: You might not see data-test-id attributes as they are removed from the DOM, to debug them pass a e2e-test query parameter to the URL. titlestring Establishes the title of the cell. This is used for tooltip purposes, when the width of the column is small enough to not show the entire heading. Defaults to the stringified version of the provided children. valuefunction Function that is used to extract the raw value representing a column. The raw value may be a boolean (e.g. if you render a checkbox), a number (if you render a metric) or text for others. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. This function is used for sorting the table (by the given value) as well as for the heuristics of 'fit-content' widths. widthstring DEFAULT 1fr Represents the width of the column. It is always a string, and it can be of one of the following types: 'fit-content': the column will take the minimum required space to allocate all items in the column. For virtualized lists, a heuristic will be used to avoid rendering all cells. 'YYpx': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in pixels. 'YY%': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in percentage, relative to the size of the available space where the table is being rendered. 'YYfr': where YY is a number, it represents a fraction of the available width. Fractions are proportional ones to others; for instance, a table with two columns (1fr and 2fr) will have the second column twice as large as the first one. If, after computing the widths, the overall size of the table does not cover the available space, all columns will be proportionally stretched to fit all available space.",

Should be used only for positioning and spacing purposes. compactboolean DEFAULT false Establishes whether the table should render in compact mode (compact mode has narrower rows). In general, use the standard mode, since compact is reserved for data representation, e.g. in a dashboard. itemsany[] DEFAULT [] The items to be used when rendering. They are required when rendering items with a render callback. Each item can have any structure and type possible, and will the corresponding one will be provided when rendering each element list. mainColumnnumber DEFAULT 0 Column containing the main data identifying the row.

Note: The multivalue mode works only in the default size, not in compact. onLoadMorefunction Callback fired when more items must be loaded. This happens when you're lazy loading the items and the items that are about to render cannot be found in the items array. This callback should be used to fetch/load the missing items from the backend or other sources. The returned Promise should be resolved once item data has finished loading. It will be used to determine when to refresh the list with the newly-loaded data. This callback may be called multiple times in reaction to a single scroll event. function ( cursor : Cursor Items to load. ) onSelectfunction Function called when the user clicks over a row checkbox. It is called with the event of the checkbox, as well as with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. When the user selects or unselects the header checkbox (select / unselect all), the callback will be called once for every item, representing individual clicks over each row. The header checkbox state is automatically controlled by the table. function ( event : React.ChangeEvent, selectedItem : SelectedCallbackArgument ) rowCountnumber Number of rows. By default it's equal to length of array passed in the items prop. You should specify the rowCount when you know the total number of items but you want to lazy load them while scrolling. selectedfunction Function that returns whether a row is selected. It needs to return a boolean representing the state of the row. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. function ( item : SelectedCallbackArgument ) => boolean selectionTypeenum DEFAULT Table . SELECTION_TYPE . BULK Sets the selection mode of the Table. Use it along with onSelect and selected props to determine which row is checked by the user. Table.SELECTION_TYPE.BULK displays checkboxes per each row, along with a checkbox in the header to select all items. When an item is selected, header actions become available. Table.SELECTION_TYPE.SINGLE doesn't display checkboxes, the user picks a row by just clicking on it. Though not enforced in the component, the selected callback should return true only for one item. Check the examples of the component to see how it works. <One of Table.SELECTION_TYPE.BULK , Table.SELECTION_TYPE.SINGLE , > spacingTypeenum[] Spacing property.

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=true: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages. Reduce data ingest Our charts support setting an option to reduce the amount of data ingest at the cost of dropping detailed information. To enable it, set global.lowDataMode=true in the nri-bundle chart. lowDataMode affects three specific components of the nri-bundle chart outlined below. Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration If lowDataMode is enabled, the following metrics are excluded by default as they are already collected and used by the New Relic Kubernetes Integration. - kube_ - container_ - machine_ - cadvisor_ Copy New Relic Logging If lowDataMode is enabled, Labels and Annotations are set to Off in the Filter section of the fluent-bit.conf file. This means that this detail will be dropped from the container log files which reduces the overall data ingest into New Relic. The following fields are retained: Allowlist_key container_name Allowlist_key namespace_name Allowlist_key pod_name Allowlist_key stream Allowlist_key log Copy Low Data Mode Log Example Complete Log Record [ { \"cluster_name\": \"api-test\", \"kubernetes\": { \"annotations\": { \"kubernetes.io/psp\": \"eks.privileged\" }, \"container_hash\": \"fryckbos/test@sha256:5b098eaf3c7d5b3585eb10cebee63665b6208bea31ef31a3f0856c5ffdda644b\", \"container_image\": \"fryckbos/test:latest\", \"container_name\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"docker_id\": \"134e1daf63761baa15e035b08b7aea04518a0f0e50af4215131a50c6a379a072\", \"host\": \"ip-192-168-17-123.ec2.internal\", \"labels\": { \"app\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"app.kubernetes.io/name\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"controller-revision-hash\": \"84db95db86\", \"pod-template-generation\": \"1\", \"release\": \"nri-bundle\" }, \"namespace_name\": \"nrlogs\", \"pod_id\": \"54556e3e-719c-46b5-af69-020b75d69bf1\", \"pod_name\": \"nri-bundle-newrelic-logging-jxnbj\" }, \"message\": \"[2021/09/14 12:30:49] [ info] [engine] started (pid=1)\\n\", \"plugin\": { \"source\": \"kubernetes\", \"type\": \"fluent-bit\", \"version\": \"1.8.1\" }, \"stream\": \"stderr\", \"time\": \"2021-09-14T12:30:49.138824971Z\", \"timestamp\": 1631622649138 } ] Copy Log Record after enabling lowDataMode.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Unless hosting the images in a local image repository, connections to either quay.io or docker.io will need to be allowed through your firewall in order for Docker to pull the synthetics-minion and synthetics-minion-runner images. The \"runner\" image is pulled automatically on startup of the synthetics-minion container. See Docker environment configuration and Kubernetes environment configuration for details on how to set a local repository and the runner registry endpoint. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. As a Kubernetes user, you might consider Auto-telemetry with Pixie for deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you don't want to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Before you start the install, make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free! No credit card required. If your New Relic account is in the EU region, choose the EU install option. Get an account Start the installer Eu guided install Or, for fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page.

      "info": "Learn how to provision New Relic resources using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).",
      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations!

You can configure Incident Intelligence destinations to send data to PagerDuty or webhooks. This document gives examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON formats. EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Destination template examples The following template example destinations are formatted in Jinja2. Suggested OpsGenie template example { \"alias\": {{ id }}, \"message\": {{ ui_name }}, \"source\": '{{ sources }}', \"priority\": {{ priority }}, \"details\": { \"self_url\": {{ url }}, \"state\": {{ state }}, \"is_correlated\": {{ is_correlated }}, \"created_on\": {{ created_on }}, \"modified_on\": {{ modified_on }}, \"activated_on\": {{ active_since }}, \"closed_on\": {% if closed_on is defined %} {{ closed_on }} {% else %} None {% endif %}, \"is_correlated\": {{ is_correlated }} }, \"description\": \"\"\"Incidents [ {% for incident in incidents %} { \"id\": {{ incident.id }}, \"events_count\": {{ incident.events_count }}, \"labels\": {{ incident.labels }}, \"title\": {{ incident.title }}, \"description\": {{ incident.description }}, \"state\": {{ incident.state }}, \"sources\": {{ incident.sources }}, \"modified_on\": {{ incident.modified_on }}, \"opened_on\": {{ incident.opened_on }}, \"closed_on\": {{ incident.closed_on }} } {% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %} ]\"\"\" } Copy Suggested ServiceNow template example { \"short_description\": {{ ui_name }}, \"description\": 'Issue Id: {{ id }}, \\n Description: {{ description }}, \\n Sources: {{ sources }}, \\n Priority: {{ priority }}, \\n Details: { \\n self_url: {{ url }}, \\n state: {{ state }}, \\n is_correlated: {{ is_correlated }}, \\n created_on: {{ created_on }}, \\n modified_on: {{ modified_on }}, \\n activated_on: {{ active_since }}, \\n closed_on: {% if closed_on is defined %} {{ closed_on }} {% else %} None {% endif %}, \\n is_correlated: {{is_correlated}} }, \\n\\n incidents: {{ incidents }}, \\n\\n pathways: {{ pathways }}' } Copy Suggested Slack template example Go to Slack incoming WebHooks Choose the right Slack workspace and click \"Add to Slack\" Select the destination channel to receive the notifications to Click “Add Incoming WebHooks Integration” Copy the WebHook URL In the next screen, click “Save settings” at the bottom.

With New Relic One, you can see and act on all the data throughout your entire system. To access New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com. Or, if you report data to the EU data center go to one.eu.newrelic.com. Tip Learn more about New Relic One’s basic UI features. Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Query your data more easily On the Browse data menu on the top navigation menu you can easily access your basic telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces). Wherever you go in the UI, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Build NRQL and PROMQL-like queries. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. New Relic One dashboards let you build better visualizations more easily, with more options to customize. Dashboard features include: Perform NRQL queries and create charts and dashboards everywhere in the platform using the query builder. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our agents, integrations, and APIs. Share dashboards or charts as a .pdf, or embed a chart in an external site. Tip If you previously used New Relic Insights to create dashboards, these are available as New Relic One dashboards. Build on New Relic One If custom charts and dashboards don't solve your current challenge, we give you a framework for building React JavaScript applications that: Live on New Relic One, alongside your other New Relic-monitored data. Feature highly tailored visualizations. Display data from any source you want, whether from a New Relic-monitored entity or data from any service or API. And you can use open source apps built by the community, and contribute your own open source apps. To learn more, see New Relic One applications. What’s next? To get started understanding how to get around in New Relic One: See what data you have available with the data explorer. Browse your monitored entities with the New Relic Explorer.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl.

Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Global Performance data sets data are useful for: Existing New Relic customers who want to gain general monitoring and troubleshooting insights from a curated collection of aggregated, real-world data. Newcomers who want to get a feel for New Relic’s dashboards and data tools and view real data visualizations in order to make informed decisions about how to add their own data to New Relic. This resource provides information about the Global Performance data sets, how they work, what they do, and current options for accessing Global Performance data. Public API Performance dashboard Important Please note: Global Performance data sets are presented as-is. Global Performance data sets represent an aggregate of samples across a range of sources, and New Relic makes no effort to attempt to confirm the correctness, completeness, or veracity of the data. This data should not be relied on as the sole source of information for any purpose you may use it, and New Relic is not responsible for decisions made in reliance on this data. Global Performance data sets should not be viewed as either an endorsement or a recommendation by New Relic of the technologies represented in the data sets. Access valuable data and try out New Relic Our first Global Performance data set, Public API Performance, offers a large body of real-world, real-time data about the performance of public APIs including AWS, Google, and more as experienced by New Relic customers (as authorized). Because this data is already flowing through New Relic, you can access it within seconds of activating your account, and test drive New Relic dashboarding and querying capabilities in the process. There’s no need to connect your own data sources to New Relic first, although we recommend you do so because adding your own data is easy, free, and the best way to understand how New Relic can serve your business needs. Get started with the Public API Performance dashboard To help you get started using Public API Performance data, we've created a Public API Performance dashboard. This dashboard provides both actionable general insights and analytics and also an example of how you might apply dashboarding capabilities to your own data. Both new and existing customers should be able to view Global Performance data in the Public API Performance dashboard quickly and easliy. To start using this dashboard, see Explore the Public API Performance dashboard.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing.

This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features. To find out more, see the table of contents for APM. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in 5 simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account (it's free, forever!). Install and customize the language agent for your app. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for New Relic to start receiving your data. Log in to your account, and start exploring New Relic! Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, including your apps, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. If data does not appear after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips for your APM agent.",

      "body": "With a quickstart, you let your users quickly install dashboards, alerts, and other resources. Here, you learn how to use New Relic's GraphQL API, NerdGraph, to query your existing alert conditions and configure them in your quickstart. Important This guide assumes you already have alerts in your New Relic account and a quickstart that you want to add those alerts to. If you don't already have a quickstart, follow our lab to learn how to build one. Set up your quickstart's alerts directory This guide assumes you have a quickstart. However, your quickstart may or may not already have alerts. Either way, to add alerts to your quickstart, you need an alerts directory. If your quickstart already has one, you can skip this section. The _template directory of New Relic One quickstarts contains an alerts template folder. Copy this folder to your quickstart. From here, you use the YAML file that corresponds to the alert condition type you want to add to your quickstart. Once your quickstart is ready to add alerts, you need to look up your alert condition's ID. Look up your alert's condition ID To populate your alert configurations with NerdGraph, you first need to look up its identifier. Step 1 of 5 From your New Relic homepage, go to Alerts & AI. Step 2 of 5 Click Policies in left hand navigation. Step 3 of 5 Choose your policy from the list. Step 4 of 5 Here, you see the list of conditions. Choose the condition that you want to query. Step 5 of 5 On the Next page, you see ID, Account, and Policy associated with the condition. Copy the ID. With this identifier, you can now query your alert conditions and use the response to build out alert resources in your quickstart. Query alert conditions in NerdGraph There are three types of alerts you can have in New Relic: Static Baseline Outlier Jump to the appropriate section for the kind of alert you want to add to your quickstart. Query your static alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name type nrql { query } valueFunction terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlStaticCondition for your condition's ID, name, query and more. These are the required fields you need to create the same alert in your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get a JSON representation of the specified condition. Next, use this response to add a static alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane. Step 4 of 4 Populate static-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Static Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the host count is < 2. # Type of alert type: STATIC # NRQL query nrql: query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction\" # Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE) valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Operator used to compare against the threshold. operator: BELOW # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a static alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your baseline alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { id name nrql { query } baselineDirection terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition for your condition's name, query, baselineDirection, and other fields required to add the condition to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data of your alert. Next, use this response to add baseline alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane.

Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Baseline Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the average Transaction duration deviates 2 standard deviations from the normal. # Type of alert type: BASELINE # NRQL query nrql: # Baseline alerts can use an optional FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" # Direction in which baseline is set (Default: LOWER_ONLY) baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600, must be a multiple of 60 for Baseline conditions thresholdDuration: 180 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a baseline alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your outlier alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { id name nrql { query } expectedGroups terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition for required fields to add an outlier alert to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data for your alert condition. Next, use this response to add a outlier alert to your quickstart. Step 4 of 4 Populate outlier-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Outlier Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered when any facet(s) deviate from the center of the group for at least 5 mins # Type of alert type: OUTLIER # NRQL query nrql: # Outlier alerts require FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET http.statusCode\" # Number of groups expected in the returned values for the condition (Default: 2) expectedGroups: 4 # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 1 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 2592000 Copy Here, you added an outlier alert to your quickstart.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Workloads help you understand the status of complex systems, detect issues, understand the cause and impact of an incident, and resolve those issues quickly. Tip To use workloads and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing.

      "body": "For accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan, we provide a View your usage UI for understanding billing-related usage and a Manage your data UI for managing billing-related data. Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

With New Relic One, you can see and act on all the data throughout your entire system. To access New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com. Or, if you report data to the EU data center go to one.eu.newrelic.com. Tip Learn more about New Relic One’s basic UI features. Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Query your data more easily On the Browse data menu on the top navigation menu you can easily access your basic telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces). Wherever you go in the UI, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Build NRQL and PROMQL-like queries. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. New Relic One dashboards let you build better visualizations more easily, with more options to customize. Dashboard features include: Perform NRQL queries and create charts and dashboards everywhere in the platform using the query builder. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our agents, integrations, and APIs. Share dashboards or charts as a .pdf, or embed a chart in an external site. Tip If you previously used New Relic Insights to create dashboards, these are available as New Relic One dashboards. Build on New Relic One If custom charts and dashboards don't solve your current challenge, we give you a framework for building React JavaScript applications that: Live on New Relic One, alongside your other New Relic-monitored data. Feature highly tailored visualizations. Display data from any source you want, whether from a New Relic-monitored entity or data from any service or API. And you can use open source apps built by the community, and contribute your own open source apps. To learn more, see New Relic One applications. What’s next? To get started understanding how to get around in New Relic One: See what data you have available with the data explorer. Browse your monitored entities with the New Relic Explorer.

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple users. To control how basic users upgrade to become full users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to our more curated observability UI experiences (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full users or request upgrade access from admins. Full user. Details: Full users have access to everything (dependent on role restrictions), which includes our curated observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user is considered a full user and has full user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role. Bulk user management With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles for users on the original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Bulk user management troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes. Integration Permissions Google AppEngine n/a; Google App Engine does not require additional permissions. Google BigQuery bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.list Google Cloud Functions cloudfunctions.locations.list Google Cloud Load Balancing n/a; Google Cloud Load Balancing does not require additional permissions.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "Most data generated by integrations is available in New Relic One dashboards, where you can query your data using NRQL and build custom dashboards. The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK. For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see New Relic data types. Get started with integration data Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic: From the one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries. Use the data explorer or the dashboards to explore and understand the available data. Read the documentation for a specific integration to learn about the reported data. When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by entityName: SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's a NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group: SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's a NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time: SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Here's a NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in a dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections: SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data when querying: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to this data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "Use our New Relic query language (NRQL) to create alerts conditions with ease. Your condition describes what you want to be notified about, and only requires two attributes: a query and a threshold. The query defines the data that's important to you, and determines what you want to be notified about. The threshold determines when you’ll be notified. Follow these steps to write your first alerts condition using a NRQL query and a threshold. Once you're done, you'll have a working alert condition. Step 1: Write your query You can use a NRQL query to return data about how your environment is performing. Then, you can create a condition from that query. In this example, a condition is created for each host's CPU utilization (query), which will trigger a notification when the CPU utilization is above the 0.7% (threshold). Generally, you won't use thresholds below 1%, but this example simply shows you how to set up a threshold. Find the NRQL query builder at the top of the UI. Click the Query your data button to open the query builder and start writing a NRQL query. Once you've written a valid query, you can create a condition from it. The condition shows each host’s CPU utilization. Use this NRQL query, or something similar that's relevant to what you're monitoring, to create a condition. This query finds the average CPU utilization in an environment and then breaks it down (facets) by individual host names. Once you've created a valid NRQL query, click Create alert. Learn more about the NRQL syntax to create other useful queries. Step 2: Name your NRQL condition Give your NRQL condition a name that's meaningful to you. Step 3: Set your condition thresholds Set critical and warning thresholds to determine when you’re notified about your environment's performance. A critical threshold is required for your alerts condition. A warning threshold is optional. These thresholds don't create an incident or notify you like the critical threshold does. If a critical threshold opens an incident and notifies you, warning threshold violations created afterwards will be included in the report. In this example from the Set your condition thresholds section, our critical threshold (red) checks for any hosts with CPU utilization over 0.7% for at least 5 minutes. A warning threshold (yellow) is also added showing when any host's CPU utilization goes over 0.67% for at least 5 minutes. After you enter threshold values, you can see the threshold lines on the graph: Step 4: Create a policy Finally, add your condition to an existing policy or create a new one. When you create a new policy, you can group your violations by policy, condition, or by violation (this creates an incident for each violation). These incident preferences settings determine how frequently you're notified when there's a violation. What's next? Now that you've created your first condition, set up your incident preferences and notification channels. For a detailed, comprehensive overview of NRQL conditions, see Create NRQL alert conditions",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

      "body": "lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to diagnose common issues using New Relic. Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, View your services, before starting this one. In this procedure, you use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Diagnose high response times in Telco Lite Step 1 of 10 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services: The overview includes the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services. Step 2 of 10 On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: Here, you see that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. Step 3 of 10 From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Step 4 of 10 Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. Next, drill into the fulfillment service for even more information. Step 5 of 10 Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: You're now looking at the main:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Step 6 of 10 Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole: Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs and tables it shows, such as Throughput, Error rate, and Hosts. Next, look at the host to see what's happening. Step 7 of 10 First, switch to the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Step 8 of 10 Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Step 9 of 10 Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Step 10 of 10 Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes.

From here, you use the YAML file that corresponds to the alert condition type you want to add to your quickstart. Once your quickstart is ready to add alerts, you need to look up your alert condition's ID. Look up your alert's condition ID To populate your alert configurations with NerdGraph, you first need to look up its identifier. Step 1 of 5 From your New Relic homepage, go to Alerts & AI. Step 2 of 5 Click Policies in left hand navigation. Step 3 of 5 Choose your policy from the list. Step 4 of 5 Here, you see the list of conditions. Choose the condition that you want to query. Step 5 of 5 On the Next page, you see ID, Account, and Policy associated with the condition. Copy the ID. With this identifier, you can now query your alert conditions and use the response to build out alert resources in your quickstart. Query alert conditions in NerdGraph There are three types of alerts you can have in New Relic: Static Baseline Outlier Jump to the appropriate section for the kind of alert you want to add to your quickstart. Query your static alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name type nrql { query } valueFunction terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlStaticCondition for your condition's ID, name, query and more. These are the required fields you need to create the same alert in your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get a JSON representation of the specified condition. Next, use this response to add a static alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane. Step 4 of 4 Populate static-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Static Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the host count is < 2. # Type of alert type: STATIC # NRQL query nrql: query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction\" # Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE) valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Operator used to compare against the threshold. operator: BELOW # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a static alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your baseline alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { id name nrql { query } baselineDirection terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition for your condition's name, query, baselineDirection, and other fields required to add the condition to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data of your alert. Next, use this response to add baseline alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane. Step 4 of 4 Populate baseline-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Baseline Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the average Transaction duration deviates 2 standard deviations from the normal. # Type of alert type: BASELINE # NRQL query nrql: # Baseline alerts can use an optional FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" # Direction in which baseline is set (Default: LOWER_ONLY) baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600, must be a multiple of 60 for Baseline conditions thresholdDuration: 180 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a baseline alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your outlier alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { id name nrql { query } expectedGroups terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition for required fields to add an outlier alert to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data for your alert condition. Next, use this response to add a outlier alert to your quickstart. Step 4 of 4 Populate outlier-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Outlier Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered when any facet(s) deviate from the center of the group for at least 5 mins # Type of alert type: OUTLIER # NRQL query nrql: # Outlier alerts require FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET http.statusCode\" # Number of groups expected in the returned values for the condition (Default: 2) expectedGroups: 4 # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 1 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 2592000 Copy Here, you added an outlier alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace, @TraceLambda or @TraceByReturnType annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath as it contains all these annotations. @Trace Annotating a method with @Trace tells the Java agent that measurements should be taken for that method. To add a method call as a custom trace add @Trace annotations to your method. import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; ... @Trace public void run() { // background task } Copy Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy @TraceLambda If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include lambda expressions within the trace, you can use the @TraceLambda annotation without parameters: import com.newrelic.api.agent.TraceLambda; @TraceLambda class ClassContainingLambdaExpressions() { // work } Copy Lambda expressions become static methods of the containing class after compilation. By default, static methods within classes marked with the @TraceLambda annotation matching the annotations pattern will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Properties for @TraceLambda The @TraceLambda annotation supports the following properties. pattern Type: String Default: ^\\$?(lambda\\|anonfun)\\$(?\\<name\\>.*) If you set the pattern, as in @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\"), then the marked classes method names will be matched against the regex pattern YourPattern. If matched the related method will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\") Copy includeNonstatic Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the marked classes nonstatic methods will be eligible for assessment against the pattern for instrumentation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(includeNonstatic=\"true\") Copy @TraceByReturnType To include methods with a particular return type within the trace, you can use the @TraceByReturnType annotation to mark a class passing the return types as a property. Methods in annotated classes that match one of the specified return types will be marked with the @Trace annotation. @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { // ... } Copy Properties for @TraceByReturnType The @TraceByReturnType annotation supports the following properties. traceReturnTypes Type: List < Class> Default: empty list If you set the traceReturnTypes, as in @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={String.class}), then the marked classes method return types will be matched against the String.class. All matched methods will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { public String doSomething() { // matches // ... } public Long somethingElse() { // does not match // ... } } Copy Performance considerations When the Java agent is present in the JVM, it will inject code on the annotated methods. The performance hit is negligible in heavyweight operations, such as database or webservice calls, but is noticeable in methods that are called frequently, such as an accessor called thousands of times a second. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to decreased performance and to a metric grouping issue.

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers. This fix brings the Java Agent into compliance with the behavior of other New Relic Agents. Fixes an issue in which custom Hystrix Commands that are subclassed multiple times in Groovy cause an application to throw an exception on startup.",

For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Learn about the type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. Headers Copy For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. See an example of W3C trace context headers implementation in DT API usage with Kafka. Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Understand a utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage Important Cross application tracing has been deprecated as of agent version 7.4.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead of using cross application tracing, we recommend our distributed tracing features. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems. To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "This doc contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically manage some New Relic API keys. For general information about New Relic keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description You can use the API keys UI to create and manage keys. Alternatively, you can use NerdGraph's ApiAccess field to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: User keys License keys, including: General license key (used for APM, infrastructure monitoring, more) Browser key (for browser monitoring) One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. Notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Regarding license keys: License keys are categorized by NerdGraph as ingest keys. This is because their main use is to allow data ingest. You can create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't manage or delete original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage keys you've created. Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query user keys in similar ways, replacing the ingest-key-specific fields with user-key-specific fields. To understand the data structure, we recommend experimenting with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete user keys using the UI. Create keys Tip You can find and generate user keys using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, at the top of that interface. To create multiple keys (user key or license key) in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a user key: Create a user key To create a user key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Copy Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data.

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. Tip The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='my-app-name'\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW aggregationDelay: 120 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } Copy NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW aggregationDelay: 120 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW aggregationDelay: 120 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Copy Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } Copy Tip The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } } } Copy In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } Copy In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Copy Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Copy Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow aggregationMethod aggregationDelay aggregationTimer } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow aggregationMethod aggregationDelay aggregationTimer } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } Copy Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Copy Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: { description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"} ) { description } } Copy Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } Copy",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

Event Flow is the default data aggregation option because this method is more likely to result in fewer dropped data points due to latency in most situations, and decreased time-to-detect. Event Timer Event Timer is designed to work best for data that comes infrequently and potentially in batches; for example, cloud integrations or error logs. Event Time, as its namesake, has a Timer setting that starts counting down as soon as the first data point shows up for the aggregation window. It resets every time another data point arrives for that window. Cadence Cadence is the legacy data aggregation everyone has grown to know. For this data aggregation option each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the Delay setting is set for. A limitation of this option is that a certain amount of data may be dropped, as it comes in \"too late\" to be evaluated. This dropped data may trigger false alerts.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Baseline alerting is useful for creating conditions that: Only notify you when data is behaving abnormally. Dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, including daily or weekly trends. In addition, baseline alerting works well with new applications when you do not yet have known behaviors. How it works When you choose a data source (for example, an APM metric) for a baseline condition, we'll use the past values of that data to dynamically predict the data's near-future behavior. The line of that predicted future behavior for that value is called a baseline. It appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the baseline condition UI. You'll use the baseline alert condition UI to: Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source. Set the behavior that will trigger a violation (for example: \"deviating for more than five minutes\"). Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both.

Use the slider bar to adjust the Critical threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the baseline. The tighter the band around the baseline, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate. Optional: You can create a Warning threshold (the darker gray area around the baseline). For NRQL alerts, see the allowed types of NRQL queries. If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Faceted baseline conditions NRQL alerts conditions support faceted baselines. In the chart legend, click a time series to scope it to a single facet.

The single time series shows the baseline, threshold band, and one or more violation regions, if there are any. Baseline rules and settings Here are some details about how the UI works: Rules governing creation of baseline The algorithm for baseline conditions is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities: Data trait Baseline rules Age of data On initial creation, the baseline is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and baseline type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the baseline will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the baseline and thresholds will become. Consistency of data For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the baseline. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds. Regular fluctuations For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the baseline algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them. Baseline direction: select upper or lower ranges You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the baseline (\"upper\") or that goes below the baseline (\"lower\"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the Baseline direction selector. Example use cases for this: You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down. You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem. Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different baseline direction settings. The red areas represent violations. Preview chart: select 2 or 7 days Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions. When setting thresholds, the preview chart has an option for displaying Since 2 days ago or Since 7 days ago. These selections are not the time period used to compute the baseline; they are only the time range used for a preview display. For more about the time range used to calculate the baseline, see the algorithm rules.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

CPU Usage Alert Type: STATIC This alert fires when a host's CPU usage goes above 90 percent for a period of 5 minutes. Errors Alert Type: STATIC This alert fires when 10 percent of the transactions against an application end with an error, over a period of 5 minutes. Memory Usage Alert Type: STATIC When memory limits are reached, applications can do weird and unpredictable things. This alert fires when the percentage of memory used on a host exceeds 90 percent for 5 minutes. Response time Alert Type: STATIC This alert fires when the average transaction duration is above 5 seconds for 5 minutes. Throughput Alert Type: STATIC Throughput is a great way to measure the health of your applications. This alert fires when the throughput of a web application drops below 5 transactions in a 5 minute period. This quickstart doesn't include any data sources . Do you think it should?

      "body": "lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to diagnose common issues using New Relic. Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Diagnose high response time, before starting this one. In this procedure, you use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Diagnose error alerts in Telco Lite Step 1 of 16 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu to see an overview of all Telco Lite services including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 16 Select the Telco-Web Portal service name: You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed. Step 3 of 16 From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Step 4 of 16 Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you better understand what happened during that request. Step 5 of 16 Select the Errors column header twice to order the table by descending counts: Step 6 of 16 Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Step 7 of 16 Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Step 8 of 16 Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service: Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Web transactions time, in APM, also shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. Next, explore JVMs to see what's happening. Step 9 of 16 Open Monitor > JVMs in the left-hand navigation: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Step 10 of 16 Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. The next step is to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Step 11 of 16 You need to navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Step 12 of 16 Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Important Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Step 13 of 16 Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 14 of 16 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. Step 15 of 16 To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is affecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 16 of 16 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise critical violation alerts The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to diagnose common issues using New Relic. Now that you've diagnosed all the issues affecting Telco Lite, tear down your services.",

      "body": "Overview IT Operations is expected to provide services that meet the business’s requirements for performance and reliability. However, many ops teams attempt to measure performance and reliability using legacy methods, like measuring resource consumption. That, in turn, requires that they create complex dashboards of granular metrics which they then try to correlate with application performance and reliability. These complex dashboards require subject matter experts to interpret the results for business stakeholders. Legacy methods create barriers to understanding what a good system state looks like and how bad system states impact the business. Essentially, IT ends up not sharing a common metric vocabulary with the business. This fundamental disconnect will result in the perception that IT is not able to deliver the services that the business requires, with all the implications and impacts that perception carries. Service Level Management (SLM) eliminates that disconnect by better explaining the overall performance of a system in terms that are easily understood by both IT and the business. The intent is to show whether or not the system is meeting its performance and reliability expectations, and if it is trending toward or away from improvement, so proactive steps can be taken. The end goal is that systems are better oriented toward desired business outcomes with IT’s attention focused on issues in areas with the highest business impact. You are a good candidate for SLM if any of the following are true: The business impact of performance and reliability issues are not well understood by all stakeholders. Your MTTx is too high. You are collecting many resource consumption metrics (such as CPU, disk, or memory) or are maintaining many metric correlation rules in order to identify system problems. You can’t see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome Service Level Management’s overall goal is to easily measure and communicate the overall health, performance, and quality of your digital products and services to all stakeholders. By implementing SLM at key output points in your systems, you will have a simpler and more responsive observability practice, tighter alignment with the business, and faster paths to improvement. The SLM process described in this guide will help you to identify the points in your systems where you should measure the key performance metrics of service performance and quality. It will also define and drive a simpler alerting strategy, continuous improvement methodologies, and improved problem resolution workflows. Key performance indicators You will use the SLM process to collect and measure the following KPIs, often referred to as the “Golden Signals”: Service Response Time Service Quality (error rate) Service Level Objective Attainment (Availability) Service Uptime These KPIs directly measure the most important aspects of an IT service, speed and quality, in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand and communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Detailed information on each metric follows. Service response time KPI Service response time measures the amount of time a service requires to process a transaction. It starts when a transaction request is received by the service and ends when the response is sent. Goal: Reduce transaction response time. Best practices: Measure response time at service boundaries. Use continuous improvement processes to drive down response times. Ensure that non-business transactions (i.e. health checks) are not included / measured. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service quality KPI Service quality is the number of transactions that result in an unhandled error. Typically, these are transactions whose HTTP response code is greater than or equal to 400. Goal: Reduce the number of unhandled errors. Best practices: Measure error rates at service boundaries. Continually identify and remediate sources of high error volumes. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service level objective attainment KPI SLO attainment is the percentage of time a business service is meeting its response time and quality goals. Goal: Improve response time and quality to ensure high SLO attainment. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service uptime KPI Service uptime is the percentage of time a service can be reached by at least one client. Typically this is measured using synthetic transactions from representative remote locations. Goal: Use continuous improvement processes to watch uptime metrics and take appropriate steps to ensure uptime meets business requirements. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. You should also have a basic understanding of: New Relic One APM and infrastructure monitoring New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL New Relic One alerting best practices Establish current state of your KPIs As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of SLM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, you will need to perform the following tasks: Determine in-scope services Identify service boundaries Deploy instrumentation Perform SLM educational workshops Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs Establish / Optimize Alerting Build problem resolution workflows Execute continuous improvement review To help illustrate this process, we are going to apply it to an example IT service, an ecommerce site for a cellular telephone provider. Determine in-scope services You should first identify the IT services that are going to be in-scope for the initial iteration of the SLM process. These services should be key to ongoing business operations and as close to your customers as possible. Most commonly, you will be applying the SLM process to an application, since that is the service your customers are expecting you to deliver. SLM can be applied to infrastructure-based services; however, it is a more advanced application of SLM which is applicable to a much smaller set of organizations. If you are considering implementing SLM for infrastructure, you should ensure that the service(s) you are instrumenting are actually the closest to your organization’s end-customer. If your infrastructure is hosting a customer-facing app, then the app should be the target of SLM. Absent anything else, a good methodology for identifying in-scope services is to consult your disaster recovery plan. Typically, the most critical business services are prioritized there. Identify service boundaries Next, you should identify each service’s boundary, which is the service component that is closest to the client sending transaction requests. This should be the application receiving the request from the client, browser, or mobile device, and may also be known as the \"external API.\" Reverse proxies, CDNs, and load balancers are not part of the service boundary. Their service level compliance should be measured via the Uptime KPI (external test requests for connectivity). If your services are using APM, you can identify service boundaries using the service map or dependencies features. A service component is on a boundary if it has no inbound connections. In the example below (from a service map), you can see that the WebPortal is on the boundary. An example of using service maps in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. In contrast, the following screenshot (from the dependencies page) shows that the Inventory Service is not on a boundary since it has incoming connections from the WebPortal. Subsequent examples in this guide will build on the WebPortal service boundary. An example of using the dependencies UI in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. You should understand that the SLM process defines a service boundary as being downstream of any dependencies. The service boundary is the point where all the effects and impacts of dependent services are measured as they contribute to the total response time and quality of the service. By measuring service level compliance at the boundary, you will be able to see the impact that all service components upstream of the boundary have on service delivery. This means that your initial steps into SLM can focus on the services that are closest to your users, yet still capture the contribution of more distant services. As your practice matures, you will be able to identify the next round of upstream services that would benefit from direct SLM instrumentation. In our example, the WebService is downstream of the Fulfillment, Plan, Promo, Login, and Inventory services (among others). By applying SLM at the WebService, we will be seeing the impact of the upstream services on the WebService. Any impactful issues with an upstream service will be reflected in the WebService’s service level KPIs. By instrumenting one service, we are capturing the contribution of five additional services. This greatly simplifies our observability practice. In time, problematic upstream services will self-identify themselves as candidates for direct SLM instrumentation. Deploy instrumentation To collect SLM service response time and transaction success KPIs, you need to deploy instrumentation into the components of your production apps on the service boundary. If you don’t have instrumentation that can do this in production already, then you will need to engage the teams and stakeholders that can help you to get this done. For detailed information on deploying the New Relic instrumentation that can gather this information, see our APM install documentation. The uptime KPIs can be collected using synthetic transactions, which don’t require any instrumentation to be added to the service. If needed, you can start your SLM journey there while waiting for the direct instrumentation to be deployed. The uptime tests should perform a basic, yet realistic, check of the service’s functionality. For detailed information on this capability, see our synthetic monitoring documentation. Perform SLM educational workshops You should share the self-paced New Relic Essentials training course with the appropriate stakeholders so they can understand how the New Relic technology platform will aid in the SLM process. Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs The SLM process uses speed and quality as its key performance indicators. In technical terms, speed means response time and quality means error rate. At the end of this phase, you will have created baseline service level objectives for each service in the form of a percentage. For example: “98% of service X’s transactions will be error free and occur in less than 500 milliseconds.” For each in-scope service, you should analyze speed and quality at the service boundary. This will give you an overall understanding of how the entire service and all of its dependencies are performing. As you iterate through the SLM process, you can then identify and prioritize the upstream service components that require direct SLM instrumentation. To analyze KPIs, you should do the following for each service: Identify the volume and 95th percentile response time for each of the service’s transactions over a relatively long period of time, typically between seven days and one month. It is important that you use percentile rather than average, so you can see the entire range of response times, including outliers. If you use averages, you will hide outliers. The following is an example of the initial baseline report. Here you can see the volume, p95 response time, and error volume for the WebPortal and a few other services. The WebPortal’s p95 response time is .36 seconds (or 36 milliseconds), so we have decided to set the SLO target to 0.4 seconds. Example of an initial baseline report measuring volume and 95th percentile response time. Next you should review and identify any non-business transactions, since they should not be included in the SLO attainment calculation. For example, you should not include health check / keep alive transactions and you may not want to include administrative transactions. In the example below, we are looking at some of the transactions from the WebPortal service. We have decided that the about.jsp transaction is a non-business transaction that should not be tracked in our SLO attainment calculation. Example showing transaction breakdowns from the initial baseline report to help identify what to track (or not track) for SLO. Finally, import and edit the SLM template dashboard to exclude non-business transactions. Then use the p95 response time as your baseline response time service level objective. For the example chart, we chose 0.4 seconds as our response time threshold and set our service level objective to 95%. This means that we are expecting 95% of the WebPortal’s business transactions to complete in 0.4 seconds or less and without an error. The red line on the chart shows us our 95% service level objective. Example chart now excluding the non-business transactions. As you can see, there are periods of hours where the app is not meeting its SLOs. If we are going to maintain the 95% target, we would need to identify and fix the service components or dependencies that are causing these problems. Establish or optimize alerting After you have set your service level objectives, you will then configure alerts that will inform you when your SLO attainment has dipped below your goal. These alerts will show you when incidents with a high business impact are occurring. When they are triggered, they should be given a high priority and you should engage the proper teams to start the process of diagnosing the source of the problem. A basic starting point is to configure an alert that triggers when your SLO attainment has dipped under your baseline for more than 10 minutes. For more information, see our documentation on configuring alerts. Build problem resolution workflows As we’ve been discussing, the intent of the SLM process is to identify when business impacting issues occur in your IT services. When this occurs, a diagnostic investigation should be launched. The goal of the investigation is to identify what service element is causing the business impacting issue. SLM tells you that there is a problem with business impact, the diagnostic process helps you to find where the problem is. Typically, your high level diagnostic workflow will start at the service boundary and go as follows: Look at the service’s individual transactions and see which one(s) are departing from their performance and/or response time SLOs. Look at each service component responsible for delivering that transaction until you find the component that is failing. Use in-depth diagnostics to identify the root cause of the problem and then resolve it. Execute continuous improvement review This is an ongoing phase of the SLM process where data is reviewed and adjustments are made as required. Your KPIs should be reported to upper management to ensure that stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing work and that you are meeting the SLO goals you’ve set. Periodic KPIs should be recorded and retained over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. In addition, each time you execute the continuous improvement process, you should: Review each service’s architecture to ensure your instrumentation is deployed at the boundary and that there are no observabilty gaps. Review each service’s transactions to confirm that only business transactions are included in your SLO calculations. Review each service’s SLO and determine if it meets the business’s performance and quality requirements. If it does not, then the SLO should be changed and the appropriate stakeholders notified so they can work to improve performance and quality. Review your SLO attainment and determine if any upstream services should be added to the SLM process. Next steps After you’ve established the SLM process, you should identify other services that would benefit from SLM instrumentation. These may be other front-line services or upstream dependencies of services that are covered by SLOs that have shown themselves to be frequent contributors to SLO attainment failures. As you do this, you should start to measure and report your SLM coverage as a percentage of applications covered by SLOs. For example, you may say that 20% of your apps have established SLOs. As SLM expands into your organization and as its value is seen by management and other stakeholders, you may find that you need a dedicated team to manage the SLM process. The SLM process should also become a primary driver to help you prioritize issue resolution activities. SLO attainment failures are a direct indicator that your IT services are having a negative business impact which is visible to your customers as poor performance and/or unhandled errors. Value realization Once the SLM process is established, you will see a reduction in the effort required to identify business impacting issues, a better ability to communicate with your business stakeholders, and an easier time proving the business’ return on investment in IT services. Your SLM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. In addtion, you should be able to simplify your observability strategy by removing or reducing your dependency on legacy consumption metrics and the logic required to correlate them against your true goal of measuring performance and quality. Once you are firmly on the path to SLM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering. You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience.",

In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet Nerdpack item inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Or, if you report data to the EU data center go to one.eu.newrelic.com. Tip Learn more about New Relic One’s basic UI features. Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships.

      "body": "For accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan, we provide a View your usage UI for understanding billing-related usage and a Manage your data UI for managing billing-related data. Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we're upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. Learn how to browse and query data in New Relic. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps The Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

      "body": "With a quickstart, you let your users quickly install dashboards, alerts, and other resources. Here, you learn how to use New Relic's GraphQL API, NerdGraph, to query your existing alert conditions and configure them in your quickstart. Important This guide assumes you already have alerts in your New Relic account and a quickstart that you want to add those alerts to. If you don't already have a quickstart, follow our lab to learn how to build one. Set up your quickstart's alerts directory This guide assumes you have a quickstart. However, your quickstart may or may not already have alerts. Either way, to add alerts to your quickstart, you need an alerts directory. If your quickstart already has one, you can skip this section. The _template directory of New Relic One quickstarts contains an alerts template folder. Copy this folder to your quickstart. From here, you use the YAML file that corresponds to the alert condition type you want to add to your quickstart. Once your quickstart is ready to add alerts, you need to look up your alert condition's ID. Look up your alert's condition ID To populate your alert configurations with NerdGraph, you first need to look up its identifier. Step 1 of 5 From your New Relic homepage, go to Alerts & AI. Step 2 of 5 Click Policies in left hand navigation. Step 3 of 5 Choose your policy from the list. Step 4 of 5 Here, you see the list of conditions. Choose the condition that you want to query. Step 5 of 5 On the Next page, you see ID, Account, and Policy associated with the condition. Copy the ID. With this identifier, you can now query your alert conditions and use the response to build out alert resources in your quickstart. Query alert conditions in NerdGraph There are three types of alerts you can have in New Relic: Static Baseline Outlier Jump to the appropriate section for the kind of alert you want to add to your quickstart. Query your static alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name type nrql { query } valueFunction terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlStaticCondition for your condition's ID, name, query and more. These are the required fields you need to create the same alert in your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get a JSON representation of the specified condition. Next, use this response to add a static alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane. Step 4 of 4 Populate static-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Static Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the host count is < 2. # Type of alert type: STATIC # NRQL query nrql: query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction\" # Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE) valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Operator used to compare against the threshold. operator: BELOW # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a static alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your baseline alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { id name nrql { query } baselineDirection terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition for your condition's name, query, baselineDirection, and other fields required to add the condition to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data of your alert. Next, use this response to add baseline alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane. Step 4 of 4 Populate baseline-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Baseline Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the average Transaction duration deviates 2 standard deviations from the normal. # Type of alert type: BASELINE # NRQL query nrql: # Baseline alerts can use an optional FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" # Direction in which baseline is set (Default: LOWER_ONLY) baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600, must be a multiple of 60 for Baseline conditions thresholdDuration: 180 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a baseline alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your outlier alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { id name nrql { query } expectedGroups terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition for required fields to add an outlier alert to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data for your alert condition. Next, use this response to add a outlier alert to your quickstart. Step 4 of 4 Populate outlier-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Outlier Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered when any facet(s) deviate from the center of the group for at least 5 mins # Type of alert type: OUTLIER # NRQL query nrql: # Outlier alerts require FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET http.statusCode\" # Number of groups expected in the returned values for the condition (Default: 2) expectedGroups: 4 # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 1 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 2592000 Copy Here, you added an outlier alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want.

      "body": "You can use the New Relic NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to make New Relic Query Language (NRQL) queries. To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. NRQL queries made through NerdGraph are subject to NRQL Query Rate Limits. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

      "body": "You might find that you ingest data you don't need or want. You can drop some types of data, which enables you: To filter out unimportant low-value data To filter out potentially sensitive data If you choose to drop data, only new data will be affected. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted. Tip If you are sending data to New Relic using Prometheus remote write, you can also drop data by changing the remote_write section of your YAML config file. For more information, see Drop data using Prometheus remote write. Requirements You must have a user role with permissions for dropping data. Currently the following data types can be targeted for data dropping: APM-reported events Browser-reported events Mobile-reported events Synthetics-reported events Custom events (like those generated by the APM agent APIs or the Event API) Log data Trace spans Default infrastructure monitoring events and infrastructure integrations events, with this exception: Downsampled SystemSample, ProcessSample, NetworkSample and StorageSample with time windows longer than 59 minutes can't be dropped. This data doesn't count towards your data ingest. Dimensional metrics, with these caveats: Billing impacts: for New Relic One pricing, dropped data is not billable. For original pricing, dropped data is billable. For metrics generated by the events-to-metrics service: drop rules won't work but these metrics can be stopped or attributes pruned by disabling or re-configuring the events-to-metric rule. Support for additional types are planned for the future. Create drop data rule Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, please review caution information below. To drop data, create a NerdGraph-format drop rule that includes: A NRQL string that specifies what data types to drop An action type specifying how to apply the NRQL string You can form and make the call in the NerdGraph explorer. There are two ways to drop data: Drop entire data types or a data subset (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_DATA action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT * FROM DATA_TYPE_1, DATA_TYPE_2 (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) Copy For this type of drop rule, you cannot use anything other than * in the SELECT clause. Drop attributes from data types (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_ATTRIBUTES action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM DATA_TYPE (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) Copy For this type of drop rule, you must pass in a non-empty list of raw attributes names. NRQL restrictions Not all NRQL clauses make sense for generating drop rules. You can provide a WHERE clause to select data with specific attributes. Other features such as TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH, FACET, and other clauses cannot be used. The two action types have these restrictions: DROP_DATA can use only SELECT *. DROP_ATTRIBUTES requires use of SELECT with \"raw\" attributes (attributes with no aggregator function applied). This also means you cannot use SELECT *. Additionally, there are some attributes that are integral to their data type and cannot be dropped (such as timestamp on event data). If you include them, registration will fail. Example drop rules Here are some example drop rules: Drop two event types Let's say you notice you have some event types being sent to New Relic that are not important to you. Also, stopping the source from sending those event types quickly is unrealistic, requiring changes to agents and/or API instrumentation. Using a drop rule is an easier way to accomplish the same goal. Here is an example NerdGraph call that drops two event types: Event1 and Event2. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Event1, Event2\" description: \"Drops all data for Event1 and Event2.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Drop events meeting certain criteria Let’s say you have a high volume custom event type that arrives from multiple sources. If you don't find all of that data important, you can use a drop rule. Here is an example of a drop rule that filters out events based on specific criteria. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM MyCustomEvent WHERE appName='LoadGeneratingApp' AND environment='development'\" description: \"Drops all data for MyCustomEvent that comes from the LoadGeneratingApp in the dev environment, because there is too much and we don’t look at it.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Drop sensitive attributes while maintaining the rest of the data Let's say you noticed an event has attributes that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You are working to update your services to stop sending the data, but until then, you need to cease storing further PII in New Relic. Although you could drop all of the data as it comes in the door with a DROP_DATA rule, the rest of the data still provides value. Therefore, you can register a drop rule to remove only the offending PII from your data: mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_ATTRIBUTES nrql: \"SELECT userEmail, userName FROM MyCustomEvent\" description: \"Removes the user name and email fields from MyCustomEvent\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Verify your drop rule works After you create a drop rule, verify that it is working as expected. The rule should take effect quickly after a successful registration, so try running a TIMESERIES version of the query you registered to see that the data drops off. Drop rule type NRQL DROP_DATA Drop rule NRQL: SELECT * FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Copy Validation NRQL: SELECT count(*) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Copy This should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect any thing else, invert the WHERE clause. DROP_ATTRIBUTES Drop rule NRQL: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Copy Validation NRQL: SELECT count(dropAttr1), count(dropAttr2) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Copy Both lines should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect events that contained these attributes and still should, invert the WHERE clause. View rules Here is an example NerdGraph call that returns the drop rules set on an account: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrqlDropRules { list { rules { id nrql accountId action createdBy createdAt description } error { reason description } } } } } } Copy Delete drop rules Here is an example NerdGraph call deleting two specific drop rules: mutation { nrqlDropRulesDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ruleIds: [\"48\", \"98\"]) { successes { id nrql accountId action description } failures { error { reason description } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy Audit drop rule history To see who created and deleted drop rules, query your account audit logs. The list endpoint also includes the user ID of the person who created the rule. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic does not review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Rules you create, including all information in those rules, can be viewed and edited by any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions. Only new data will be dropped. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted. Drop attributes on dimensional metric rollups Beta Feature This feature is currently in beta. Sign up here to request access! Dimensional metrics aggregate metrics into rollups for long term storage and as a way to optimize longer term queries. Metric cardinality limits are applied to this data. You can use this feature to decide which attributes you don't need for long term storage and query, but would like to maintain for real time queries. For example, adding containerId as an attribute can be useful for live troubleshooting or recent analysis, but may not be needed when querying over longer periods of time for larger trends. Due it how unique something like containerId can be, it can quickly drive you towards your metric cardinality limits which when hit stops the synthesis of rollups for the remainder of that UTC day. This feature also allows you to keep the high cardinality attributes on the raw data and drop it from rollups which gives you more control over how quickly you approach your cardinaliity limits. Usage Drop attributes from dimensional metrics rollups (with optional filter). This uses DROP_ATTRIBUTES_FROM_METRIC_AGGREGATES action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM Metric (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) Copy Here is an example NerdGraph request: mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_ATTRIBUTES_FROM_METRIC_AGGREGATES nrql: \"SELECT containerId FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'some.metric'\" description: \"Removes the containerId from long term querys.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy To verify it's working, wait 3 to 5 minutes for the rule to be picked up and for aggregate data to be generated. Then assuming the example NRQL above is your drop rule, run the following queries: SELECT count(containerId) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'some.metric' TIMESERIES SINCE 2 hours ago SELECT count(containerId) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'some.metric' TIMESERIES SINCE 2 hours ago RAW Copy The first query should drop to 0 while the second query should continue to hold steady. For more information on how to see the impact this will have on your cardiinality, check out Understand and query high cardinality metrics. Restrictions All restrictions that apply to DROP_ATTRIBUTES apply to DROP_ATTRIBUTES_FROM_METRIC_AGGREGATES with the additional restriction that you can only target the Metric data type. They also do not work on Metric queries targeting data created by an events to metrics rule or on Metric queries targeting timeslice data.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "For accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan, we provide a View your usage UI for understanding billing-related usage and a Manage your data UI for managing billing-related data. Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin Before you begin, we recommend first reading about permissions. To start building, you must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide. Step 2 of 5 In render(), include selectedChart as a constant you get from destructuring props, and remove your component's state: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

      "body": "In your application, you can display data in charts, like those used elsewhere in New Relic's user interface. The New Relic One SDK provides React components for different chart types. Once you decide the kind of data you want to present, either from New Relic or some other source, you supply that data to your chart, using props. Query New Relic data In some cases, you want to fetch data from New Relic's database. For example, you may want to display a line chart which plots the number of transactions your application receives over time. With your chart component, set the accountId and query props to query your New Relic data using NRQL: <LineChart accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" />; Copy Alternatively, you can fetch data with a NrqlQuery and set the data prop: <NrqlQuery accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\"> {({ data }) => <LineChart data={data} />} </NrqlQuery>; Copy If you're looking to visualize New Relic data, such as your web application's response times or your server's throughput, querying data in your charts is the way to go. But what if you want to create charts that aren't focused on New Relic data? The data prop is flexible enough that you can supply any arbitrary data, as long as it matches the standardized format. Craft custom data Whether you use custom data sets or the results of a NrqlQuery, a chart's data prop must be an array of objects where each object has both of the following fields: metadata: Defines how the chart presents its data data: An array of data points that appear on the chart For example, create a chart consisting of a line between two points by supplying two x-y coordinates in its data field: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy This LineChart plots a line between coordinates (0, 0) and (20, 10). Use x-y coordinates for all two-dimensional chart formats. For other formats, which you'll learn more about later, use other types of data points. Because data accepts an array, you can supply two series to the same chart: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'series-2', name: 'My second series', viz: 'main', color: 'red', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 50, }, { x: 20, y: 100, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy In this example, you create a single chart with two series. The first series contains the line from the last example. The second series contains a line between points (0, 50) and (20, 100). When using two series in a single chart, like this, you may want to define how the chart represents each series. Use metadata to define those elements. Metadata A series's metadata defines certain features of the series, itself, such as how it should be displayed in your chart. metadata consists of the following attributes: Attribute Description id The series's identifier. Two series having the same id are considered the same series, regardless of where they are located. In general, use a unique id for each series. However, if you use the same series for multiple charts, keeping the id consistent can help with some cross-chart functionality, like simultaneously highlighting multiple charts. name The series's name. name is used in legends, tooltips, and other areas to indicate which series you’re looking at. color The series's color. Most visualizations use this value to differentiate series. Some visualizations, like BillboardChart or JsonChart, ignore it. Use any valid CSS color representation, such as #RRGGBB, hsl(HHH, SS%, LL%), or rgba(RR, GG, BB, .AA). Avoid tweaking the alpha value, when possible, because charts use alpha to highlight or dim certain series. viz The series's visual style. While you most often use main, this field accepts several options: main: Show the series based on chart's type. For instance, a LineChart shows the series as a line, and an AreaChart shows the series as an area. line: Show the series as a line, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to AreaChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. area: Show the series as an area, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to LineChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. event: Show the series as an event, regardless of the chart's type. Charts represent an event as a vertical area behind the main visualization. Events are often used to show alerts. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. target-line: Show the series as a vertical line. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. units_data You can assign a unit type to each axis on a chart. The chart will present data according to the unit type you set with units_data. To set unit_data, pass a JSON object with maps the axis to one of the following unit types: UNKNOWN: The chart displays the series with no special units. COUNT: Each value in the chart represents a count. The chart formats values with their International System prefix. For example, \"k\" represents thousands, \"M\" represents millions, and \"G\" represents billions. PERCENTAGE: Each value in the chart represents a percentage. Typically, you provide values ranging from 0 to 1. The chart formats a value of 1 as \"100%\", a value of 2 as \"200%\", and a value of 0.01 as \"1%\". MS: Each value in the chart represents some number of milliseconds. The chart represents values higher than 1 as a human-readable time duration. For example, 60000 is represented as \"1 minute\". The chart represents values lower than 1 using SI prefixes. For example, 0.001 is represented as 1 μs. TIMESTAMP: Each value in the chart represents a timestamp, the number milliseconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the UNIX Epoch. The chart formats each value as a date. BITS: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits. The chart formats these values using \"b\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb\". BITS_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits per second. The chart formats these values using \"b/s\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb/s\". BYTES: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes. The chart formats these values using \"B\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB\". BYTES_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes per second. The chart formats these values using \"B/s\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB/s\". So, to represent the y-axis for your series in bits, set the y-value in units_data: { \"units_data\": { \"y\": \"BITS\" } } Data While a data series can contain any arbitrary values, a chart only uses values which adhere to its type. So, create your data points according to the chart type: Series Type Example Description Unidimensional [{ \"y\": 10 }, { \"y\": 20 }] The chart plots data points using y values. Use this format with BarChart, BillboardChart, PieChart, StackedBarChart. Two-dimensional [ { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 30 } ] The chart plots data points using x and y values. Use this format with AreaChart, LineChart, ScatterChart, SparklineChart, Funnel [{ \"label1\": 10, \"label2\": 20 }] The chart plots data according to labels. Use this format with FunnelChart. Table [{ \"jobType\": \"SIMPLE\", \"count\": 18 }] The chart plots data according to table columns. You must specify table columns in the metadata. Use this format with TableChart. Event [ { \"x0\": 0, \"x1\": 5 }, { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 15 } ] The chart plots the event's width based on x0 and x1 values. Histogram [ { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 20, \"y\": 100 }, { \"x0\": 30, \"x1\": 40, \"y\": 150 } ] The chart plots the series's width based on x0 and x1 and height based on y. Use this format with HistogramChart and HeatmapChart. Tip JsonChart is a special case because it processes any valid data. For example, you can set an arbitrary JSON object for the chart's data: const data = { data: [ { id: 1, name: 'Foo', price: 123, tags: ['Bar', 'Eek'], stock: { warehouse: 300, retail: 20, } } ], } <JsonChart data={data} /> Copy Special States In previous sections, you learned that a chart's data is an array of series. But you can use special values to present special chart states: null or undefined: Indicates the chart is “loading” its data. In this state, the chart shows a placeholder data set. []: Indicates there is no data to show. The chart states, \"No chart data available\". Configure your chart As you've seen, you use query or data to supply data to your chart, but you can configure other aspects of your chart, too, such as visual settings and click and hover event listeners. Read the documentation for the chart you're using for more specific information. Chart Groups Under some circumstances, you might want to synchronize events, such as dragging or scrubbing, across multiple charts. To do this, use a ChartGroup. All charts in a ChartGroup synchronize their events: <ChartGroup> <Stack> <StackItem> <LineChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\" /> </StackItem> <StackItem> <AreaChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Synthetics SINCE 1 day ago\" /> </StackItem> </Stack> </ChartGroup>; Copy Ideally, group charts that are conceptually related, and separate charts that are conceptually unrelated. Next Step Read the documentation specific to the chart you'd like to use to learn specifics about that chart's behavior and configuration.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

Step 1 of 3 Import Treemap from recharts: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 1 of 1 Destructure this.state to access selectedChart as a separate constant. Then, compare selectedChart to CHART_TYPES.Radar. If they are the same, render a RadarChart. Otherwise, render a Treemap: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal. You can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. In short, you can use the CLI to automate common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic user key. An instrumented application in your New Relic account. Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI Download the New Relic CLI for your operating system, as described below. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Using Snapcraft, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Using Homebrew, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Using Scoop, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile. After you install the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. Run the profiles add command: bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add --profile tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default --profile tutorial Important You must set the region of your New Relic account. Use -r to set either us or eu. Step 3 of 10 Get your application details. Now, add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 Retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application, use the apm application search command: bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Tip If you get an error, check that your account ID and application name are correct. Step 5 of 10 Find the guid value. If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example: [ { \"accountId\": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, \"applicationId\": YOUR_APP_ID, \"domain\": \"APM\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"A_LONG_GUID\", \"name\": \"NAME_OF_YOUR_APP\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" } ] Copy When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application. Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Here, you add an environment tag to your application. Add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 Add tag sets. What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags to your application at once, modify and run this snippet: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 Retrieve your application's tags. You've created and added some tags to your application, but to test that they're working, you need to retrieve them. Run the entity tags get command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array: [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: create a deployment marker. Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same application ID from your earlier search: bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Check the JSON response for the revision and timestamp of the deployment. You can build this workflow into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here's an example: { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands in the New Relic CLI. For example, you can create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "In alerts, an entity is defined as any target for monitoring, such as an application, a browser, or a host. The alerts UI shows available entities that you can select. You can also use the REST API and API Explorer to add or remove entities for a condition. Requirements Modifying the list of entities in a condition requires you to know: Your API key The { entity_ID} of the entity you want to monitor The { condition_ID} of the condition you want to modify General procedure To update the entity list for a condition: Locate the appropriate entity ID; for example, Application ID and browser ID. Identify the policy ID by name or type. Get the list of conditions associated with the policy and choose the one you want to modify for the appropriate category: APM, browser, and mobile External services Synthetic monitoring Modify the condition using the add or remove API requests.

Example: Add/remove an entity The following example shows how to add a Ruby application named TimberTime in a condition and how to remove an entity from that same condition. Only the first step in this example is unique to choosing the Ruby app as the entity. The remaining steps will be the same for whichever entity you choose.

In this guide, you learn how to: Use the nr1 CLI to generate a default visualization Run your visualization locally where you can quickly test and iterate Publish your visualization to the New Relic One catalog Add your visualization to a dashboard Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create a new visualization Use nr1 to generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl.

In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views';

this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps.

Confirm the errors are reporting by viewing the APM errors page. If you are not using a third party error handler, but you still do not see expected errors (for example: 404 errors): Ensure PHP is handling the error, because New Relic cannot report errors that are not recognized by PHP (such as 404 errors for static assets on the web server). Manually instrument the error you are expecting to see by using the newrelic_notice_error() API call. Confirm the errors are reporting by viewing the APM errors page. Cause PHP handles errors with its own default handler. Many third party handlers, such as XDebug or Laravel's error handler, often override PHP's default handler and capture the error instead of PHP. The PHP agent has its own error handler that relies on PHP capturing the error. Since only one handler can handle an error, the agent does not see errors that were already handled by the third party handler before it could get captured by PHP. Additionally, some errors (for example: 404 errors) often occur at the web server level, which means that PHP is never involved and the error is never captured by the agent. If PHP is used to handle 404 errors, use the newrelic_notice_error() API call to manually instrument those errors.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see your charts styled and arranged in a grid. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In just six steps, you significantly improved the readability and usability of your A/B test application, but you can take further steps to improve the usability of your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll add headings to your charts to remind yourself of what data each chart presents.

With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import VersionDescription, create descriptions for each design version, and create a new GridItem component for each design version: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you've created two VersionDescription components. You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier.

Now, you've added descriptions for your competing designs and your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll create a new section of your application from user interface components.

      "body": "Taking some time to consider your headings and document titles is time well spent. Titles and headings are not only important for search results, but they can make your docs easier to skim. For all headings, subheadings, and titles use sentence case. This means you should capitalize the first word of the title and proper nouns only. You should also capitalize the first word after a colon. Avoid dashes and ellipses in headlines and titles. Avoid using punctuation, with the exception of question marks. Use parallel construction Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns (\"Organization,\" \"Tone\"), all verbs (\"Create,\" \"Delete\"), etc. Keep it short, avoid -ing words For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: Install the agent, for example, rather than Agent installation. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity. Do not use h1 headings After you publish your doc, the docs site will automatically use what you added to the Title field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings. If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, create a GitHub issue and we'll help you with that change. Use level two headings to identify chunks of information Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (##). For example: ## Create a new user [#create-new-user] Copy Important If you don't specify an ID manually, the site will use your header text as that header's ID (also known as anchor link). Create a manual ID to preserve links to that header if you change the header text. If you have too many level sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages. Avoid using level three headings Avoid using ### headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about level three headings that make a level two section longer than a single screen height. Here are two examples of good scenarios for using level three headings: Example #1: Events-to-metrics API doc Example #2: Infrastructure integration doc",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data. In the next lesson, you'll replace the mocked data in your charts with real data from your backend service.

      "body": "Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in our database, in your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive. Example: --- apiVersion: v1 data: PL_CUSTOM_ANNOTATIONS: \"\" PL_CUSTOM_LABELS: \"\" PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" PL_ETCD_OPERATOR_ENABLED: \"false\" PL_MD_ETCD_SERVER: \"https://etcd.newrelic.svc:2379\" PX_MEMORY_LIMIT: \"\" kind: ConfigMap metadata: annotations: creationTimestamp: null labels: name: pl-cluster-config namespace: newrelic --- Copy",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent 3.9.0 or higher supports both the Java Message Service (JMS) 1.1 API and the RabbitMQ Java client library. This gives you insights into the performance of your message processing, for both incoming and outgoing messages. The APM UI will show transactions initiated via JMS 1.1 or RabbitMQ message receipt as Message background tasks. Message creation via JMS or RabbitMQ also appears in transaction traces. Performance improvements with background tasks One way to increase responsiveness of web applications is to delegate work to background processes. Message queues are commonly used for this inter-process communication. In the context of message queuing systems, applications typically interact with message brokers to send and receive messages. The RabbitMQ Java client library allows Java applications to interface with message brokers that implement the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) 0.9. New Relic's Java agent shows messages sent and received using the RabbitMQ client library and JMS. With this visibility, you can see details including: Number of messages handled by your app Time your app spends publishing messages Time your app spends processing \"dequeued\" messages APM's conveniently group and report operations that interact with temporary queues. By analyzing this information, you can more easily identify areas where processes take too much time and may be handled better as background messages. Installation requirements To monitor your RabbitMQ client activity, make sure you have downloaded and installed New Relic's Java agent version 3.9.0 or higher. To monitor JMS, make sure you have downloaded and installed New Relic's Java agent version 3.3.1 or higher. Tip For additional monitoring of your RabbitMQ systems, use the free RabbitMQ plugin for New Relic. This plugin is published and supported by Pivotal, the corporate parents of RabbitMQ. Queue operations Supported entry points for queue operations appear as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message) in APM's user interface. Queue operations Publish a message (Put in UI) Receive a message (Take in UI) RabbitMQ basicPublish basicGet, nextDelivery, and handleDelivery JMS send receive, receiveNoWait, and onMessage View message queue operations Queue operations appear in APM's Transactions page for the selected app. The Put and Take metrics appear in the Breakdown table and are categorized as MessageBroker metrics. Here is an example. one.newrelic.com > APM > (selected app) > Monitor >Transactions > (selected transaction): The transaction’s Breakdown table categorizes queue operations as MessageBroker metrics and labels them as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message). Transaction traces also may provide additional details. Tip You can select transaction traces from the app's Summary or Transactions pages in APM. The Transaction trace summary page also may show Put and Take operations in the Slowest components section. For example: one.newrelic.com > APM > (selected app) > Monitor > Summary > (selected transaction trace): In this example, the selected transaction trace's Summary shows RabbitMQ operations in the colored bar chart. The Slowest components section also lists the RabbitMQ Put and Take results. The Transaction trace page also may include a dedicated Messages tab. Here is an example. one.newrelic.com > APM > (selected app) > Monitor > Summary > (selected transaction trace): In this example, the selected transaction trace's Messages tab lists the RabbitMQ message details.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a grid, before starting this one. Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account.

However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component.

In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"categoryTerms\": [\"browser agent\"], \"keywords\": [\"a/b test\"], \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the Instant Observability category in which to place the app, search keywords, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog metadata. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application.

In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps.

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User. For more information on the various NerdStorage components, please visit the New Relic developer website API documentation.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

AbTestNerdlet (Nerdlet): displayName: AbTestNerdlet supportedEntityTypes.mode: NONE All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course.

Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another. In the next lesson, you’ll create a couple more line charts, but this time they’ll function together. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add a chart group.",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure monitoring provides an integration for Microsoft Azure's Cosmos DB service that reports your Cosmos DB metrics and inventory data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the Cosmos DB integration and describes the data that can be captured. Features New Relic gathers both database data and collection billing data from your Azure Cosmos DB service. You can monitor and alert on your Azure Cosmos DB data from New Relic, and you can create custom queries and custom chart dashboards. Activate integration To enable this integration follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic. The Cosmos DB integration requires you to create an additional role and permission to fetch database and collection data: Go to the Azure Portal and open a shell by selecting the terminal icon. Add the following command: az role definition create --role-definition '{ \"Name\": \"NewRelic Integrations\", \"Actions\": [ \"*/read\", \"Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/listKeys/action\" ], \"NotActions\": [], \"AssignableScopes\": [ \"/subscriptions/YOUR_INSERT_SUBSCRIPTION_ID\" ], \"Description\": \"Read Only for NewRelic Integrations\", \"IsCustom\": \"true\" }' Copy From Services > Subscriptions, select the subscription, go to Access control (IAM), and then select Add. In the Role search box, add the name of the newly created role definition (for example, NewRelic Integrations). In the Select search box, add the name of the New Relic integration application, and select it. Ensure that the application is added to the Selected members list, then Save. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Cosmos DB integration: Polling interval: 5 minutes Resolution: 1 minute or 5 minutes, varies by metric. For resolution information on a specific metric, see Microsoft Azure's documentation about support metrics. View and query data To view your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Cosmos DB Integration. You can query and explore your data using the following event types: Entity Event Type Provider Account AzureCosmosDbAccountSample AzureCosmosDbAccount Database AzureCosmosDbDatabaseSample AzureCosmosDbDatabase Collection AzureCosmosDbCollectionSample AzureCosmosDbCollection For more on how to find and use data, see Understand and use integration data. Metric data Important For information on deprecated Cosmos DB events or metrics, see Azure Cosmos DB integration (deprecated).

      "body": "Your New Relic users can be on one of two user models: this doc explains the New Relic One user model. Important If your New Relic organization was created before July 30 2020 and you haven't gone through a user migration process, your users are likely on our original user model. For more on this, see User model changes. Overview This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including: User type (basic user versus full user) Default user groups, including Admin and User Roles and capabilities For how to add and manage users in the UI, see User management. User type: basic and full Important This section is for users on our New Relic One user model. If you're on our original user model, see Original users. A user's user type determines if they have access to our basic features (basic user) or can access all of our curated observability UI features (full user). The user type is something meant to be set long-term based on that user's expected New Relic responsibilities. Below are details on the two user types. Note that full users are billable only if you're on New Relic One pricing. Basic user. Details: These users are free and have access to a wide range of features, including setting up and configuring any New Relic data-reporting tool, running queries of your data, using our logs UI, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. Unlike full users, they do not have access to our more curated observability UI experiences or some Applied Intelligence features (for a detailed comparison, see Capabilities). Basic users will see prompts to become a full user when they attempt to access unavailable features. For details, see Upgrade. Full user. Details: Full users have access to everything (depending on any role restrictions), including all our observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitors, access to New Relic One apps, and more. For details, see Capabilities. Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total full users. A full user can downgrade to a basic user twice in a 12-month period. To view and edit the user type of your users, use the User management UI. Learn more about basic user versus full user differences: Compare full vs basic capabilities Below is a table comparing what basic users and full users can do. A simple way to think about it is that full users have theoretical access (dependent on any chosen role restrictions) to all of our curated UI experiences, while basic users are restricted to fairly basic capabilities. Features Full user Basic user Observability UI experiences Application monitoring (APM) UI Infrastructure monitoring UI Digital Experience Monitoring UI, which includes: Browser monitoring UI Mobile monitoring UI Synthetic monitoring UI Synthetics checks Serverless monitoring UI Logs in context Distributed tracing UI Infinite Tracing (Pro and Enterprise edition) Assorted UI experiences, including: Kubernetes cluster explorer UI Errors Inbox Key transaction UI Workloads UI CodeStream integration (temporary preview access) Access to New Relic One apps Can build apps but can't access other apps New Relic One platform capabilities Full user Basic user Data ingest from any source (agents, integrations, APIs) Query data Create custom charts and dashboards Alerts and notifications APIs, including NerdGraph (basic user permissions) Query and chart log data Build New Relic One apps (but cannot access other apps) Manage New Relic data Manage other New Relic users Applied Intelligence Full user Basic user Acknowledge and resolve issues Root cause analysis Incident/anomaly analysis Correlation assistant Issue maps Machine learning classification Note that the pricing edition (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) will also affect what features you have access to. For organizations with New Relic One pricing, learn more about how full users impact billing. Tips on choosing user type A user's type (basic user vs full user) is meant to be a long-term assignment, based on the New Relic responsibilities that user is expected to perform. A full user can be downgraded to a basic user only twice in one year. Below are tips for why you'd choose full user versus basic user. Reasons to make someone a full user: They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle. They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team. They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD). They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform. They need to be able to manage users and/or billing. Reasons to make someone a basic user: They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle. They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team). They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives). They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform. They don't manage users. For accounts on New Relic One pricing, learn more about user-related billing calculations. Understand user-related billing If you're on the New Relic One pricing plan, full users are billable, and there are restrictions around how often a full user can downgrade to a basic user. For details, see User count billing details. For how to query and alert on usage data, see Query usage data. Have questions about why you can't access something? See Factors affecting access. Default groups: Admin and User For users on our New Relic One user model, a \"group\" is what allows the grouping together and managing of multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group, and that group is granted access to specific roles on specific accounts. We have two default groups: User: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but not perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users. It has access to the All product admin role, which gives access to our observability platform tools but not to the organization and user management capabilities governed by the Organization manager and Authentication manager roles. Admin: has full access and capabilities, including the organization-level admin abilities. This is the equivalent of having the All product admin, the Billing user, the Organization manager and the Authentication domain manager roles. These groups are added inside your default authentication domain, which includes the default settings of users a) being managed via New Relic and b) logging in via standard email and password. If you add other authentication domains (for SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning of users), you'd have new custom groups in those new domains to govern those users. Note that groups, whether default or custom, are not what limit a user's capabilities: it is the role that is assigned to that group (with any basic user restrictions on top of that). If your organization is Pro or Enterprise edition and you want to understand how users are granted access to specific roles and accounts, see Access grants. To change the group a user is in, use the User management UI. How do user type, roles, and groups relate to each other? For users on the New Relic One user model, here's a table explaining how user type (basic vs full user), roles, and groups relate to each other: Full user Basic user Group Full users can be assigned to default groups (User and Admin) or custom groups. When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply. A basic user's capabilities can be restricted in that way, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. For Standard edition, basic users can't be assigned to groups. For Pro and Enterprise edition, they can. Role For an explanation of the roles our default groups have, see Default groups. Custom groups can have either our default standard roles, or custom roles. A basic user's abilities aren't directly defined by a specific role. A basic user can best be described as having the All product admin role but without access to our more curated UI experiences (learn more about user type). When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. Roles and capabilities For users on the New Relic One user model, a \"role\" can be defined as \"a set of capabilities.\" A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' (learn more about capabilities). Roles are assigned to user groups. Our default groups Admin and User already have our standard roles (defined below) assigned. Organizations on Pro or Enterprise edition can also create custom roles. Standard (default) roles Roles are sets of capabilities. We have several \"standard roles,\" which are roles that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Note that some of our standard roles have hidden, non-exposed capabilities that are not available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are Standard user and Read only; all others have some hidden capabilities. Our standard roles include: Standard roles Scope Description All product admin Account Provides admin-level access to observability platform features but not organization-level and user management features. In other words, this role includes all New Relic capabilities with the exception of managing users (Authentication domain manager role), managing organization/account-structure settings (Organization manager role), and managing billing (Billing user role). Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role minus observability feature configuration capabilities. Standard user Account Provides access to observability platform features, but lacks permissions for configuring those features (for example, ability to configure synthetic monitor secure credentials) and lacks organization-level and user management permissions. Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role without that role's ability to configure platform features. Billing user Account Provides ability to manage subscriptions and billing setup, and read-only access to the rest of the platform. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account, which is why assigning this role to that primary account grants billing permissions for the entire organization. Organization manager Organization Provides the ability to manage organization settings, including organization structure, name, and preferences. Due to our recent switch to the New Relic One user model, this role currently has few abilities but more will be added over time. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Organization read only Organization Provides the ability to view organization-level settings. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain manager Organization Provides ability to add and manage users, and configure authentication domains for users on the New Relic One user model. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain read only Organization Provides the ability to view users in your organization and view the configuration of authentication domains. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Read only Account Provides read-only access to the New Relic platform (except for synthetic monitor secure credentials). Manage v1 users Account For New Relic organizations that existed before July 30 2020 and have users on our original user model, this role lets you manage those \"v1\" users. For more about how you'd assign roles to groups and create custom roles, see the user management tutorial. Capabilities A role, whether one of our standard roles or a custom role, is defined as a set of capabilities. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see Standard roles. A view of the capabilities associated with the All product admin role. When creating a custom role, you select a custom set of capabilities. Note that the capabilities we expose may change over time: this screenshot was taken in April of 2021. For how to set up roles with custom capabilities, see the user management tutorial. Manage users To learn how to add users, assign them to groups, and create custom groups and roles, see Manage users. 2020 user model changes If you'd like to understand how our user model changed in 2020 and what the impacts of that change were, see User model changes.",

      "body": "New Relic errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. Receive alerts whenever a critical, customer-impacting error arises via your preferred communication channel, like Slack. Resolve errors faster with errors from across your stack, including all APM, browser (RUM), mobile, and serverless (AWS Lambda) data, displayed on one screen. Errors are grouped to cut down on noise and collaborating across teams is easy with shared visibility to the same error data. Important Errors inbox is not available in the EU region. Why it matters Errors inbox provides a unified error tracking experience to detect and triage errors: View and triage issues across applications and services that your team cares about for faster error resolutions. Proactive notifications with detailed error information in Slack Error profiles to show similarities between error events and surface the root cause by analyzing attributes. Analyze errors in context of the full stack and resolve errors with precision. APM, browser, mobile, and AWS Lambda Functions errors are all captured in the same inbox. Set up errors inbox To enable errors inbox, follow these steps below. Afterwards, errors groups should start to appear in your inbox. From one.newrelic.com select More in the top right and click Errors inbox from the dropdown. If this is your first time accessing errors inbox, you will be prompted to select a workload in the top left. If you have no workloads set up, you will be prompted to create one before you can use errors inbox. Once you select your workload, your inbox should populate with error groups. one.newrelic.com > More > Errors inbox Monitor errors Once you've set up your errors inbox, you can begin proactively monitoring all errors in your stack: Error groups Error groups are sets of events that make up a unique error. Error groups are stored long term and contain metrics, activity log, discussions, and basic information about the unique error. Error groups are tied to the entity, making a change to the state of an error group in one errors inbox will impact all other inboxes that contain that entity. How error groups work Error events get grouped into an error group when they share the same fingerprint. As events are ingested by New Relic, we run the events through a set of managed rules that output a fingerprint. Every unique fingerprint has a single error group associated with it. The New Relic managed rules normalize the error data, identifying and ignoring unique values such as UUIDs, hex values, email addresses, etc. that would cause grouping “like” errors into unique groups. NR account ID, Entity ID, Error Class, message, and stack traces and exceptions are data that can impact a fingerprint. Troubleshooting: similar looking events do not group together If you see “like” error events grouped into different error groups incorrectly, try removing the unique identifier from the error class or message and store those as attributes instead. This will allow you to more easily facet on the attribute values and reduce the number of error groups. If you have a single application reporting as multiple entities in New Relic (i.e. running in different clusters, cells, etc), you might see duplicate error groups, since our grouping logic looks at account and entity IDs as part of the fingerprinting process. You can consider rolling up the multiple entities into a single entity and including only that rolled up entity as part of your errors inbox. You can also use the feedback tool in NR1 to share error groups that could use improved grouping. We’re continually updating our rules to improve the quality of error groups. Occurrences Your errors inbox displays the total number of occurrences of each error group within the selected timeframe. The corresponding sparkline chart displays the total number of occurrences per day over the selected timeframe as you hover over it. Sort By Filter Using the dropdown in the top right, you can sort the list of grouped errors by the number of occurrences or by the error that was last seen (latest first). Triage errors Errors status Errors inbox enables you to triage error groups right from the main screen or from the error details page. Triaging helps remove the noise from your errors inbox, and let’s you focus on the high impact errors that need attention. You can set one of three statuses, and filter your inbox by status. Unresolved: This is the default status of error groups. Resolved: Setting an error as resolved will hide it from the default inbox view unless filters are updated to include resolved errors. If events matching the error group fingerprint occur after marking an error group as resolved, it will automatically unresolve. This can be useful for identifying regressions. Ignored: Ignored will hide the error group from the inbox view unless filters are updated to include ignored errors, or until you stop ignoring the error group. Error details Clicking on a specific error group takes you to the error details page, where you will find full context of the issue. This context can assist in triaging the error and assigning it to the correct team or individual. Occurrences The occurrences page includes details like: Related account Stack trace Logs in context Error attributes Number and frequency of occurrences The detailed view also allows you to view specific errors. In the top right, you can navigate between the first instance of the error, the last, and any instance in-between. Attributes The Attributes tab enables you to quickly find commonalities between the related errors for faster resolution. Click on a specific attribute to open a sidebar with specific details. Activity Displays a log of the status changes and user assignments of an error group. Discussions The discussions provides room for detailed and organized collaboration. This is key to looping in collaborators and ensuring the entire team has the same context regardless of where they sit. Discussions includes: Threaded conversations: Reply directly to top level comments to tie replies to specific posts. Comment deletion: Delete comments. The content of the post will be removed, but the box will remain with the message comment deleted. Markdown support: Add styling and links to your comments in Markdown. Assign errors You can assign an error group to anyone. Simply select the user from the assign dropdown menu. You may also assign an error to any email address, even if they aren’t a New Relic user. You can update the filter in errors inbox to show only errors assigned to yourself, or a teammate. Important Currently assigning an error group to a user does not send a notification. Notifications of assignment and changes to error groups will be coming soon. Connect an inbox to Slack When connected to Slack, new and resurfaced error groups will be sent to a Slack channel within seconds of them occurring. This enables your team to quickly identify any new errors or regressions, and resolve them quickly with direct links to the stack trace. If your Slack workspace does not have the New Relic app installed, do that first. From an inbox, select the Inbox Settings icon (looks like a gear) in the top right corner. Toggle the Slack button to on if it is off. If no workspaces are available, click the plus button to enable Slack with a one click Slack authentication. Once authenticated, you will be able to select a Workspace and specific Channel to send notifications to. Click Test to ensure messages are being sent to the right channel. Connect errors inbox to CodeStream To use CodeStream's Open in IDE with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. Once set up, you can jump from an error group directly to the offending code in your IDE by clicking the Open in IDE button. Learn more here.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add pie charts, before starting this one. In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another. In the next lesson, you’ll create a couple more line charts, but this time they’ll function together. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add a chart group.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart components to your A/B test application, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-your-first-chart/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named newsletter-signups.js: bash Copy $ touch newsletter-signups.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called NewsletterSignups to hold your first LineChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Here, you’ve created two arbitrary data series which represent versions A and B of your test. Right now, you're using manually-crafted data points. In the future, you'll replace these with data queried from New Relic. Notice that you’ve specified a color for each series in the chart. The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test.

When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In seven steps, you’ve breathed life into your New Relic One application. Instead of a bland “Hello world” message, your application now shows a colorful line chart with two mocked data series.

      "body": "Once you've created a chart, you can customize the appearance of it to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard. Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using the data explorer to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types. Chart share and view options Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard.

      "body": "When building a query using the query builder, there are a variety of types of visualizations for presenting your data in the optimal format. This table contains all chart types. Whether a chart type is available for your query will be dependent on: The type of query (some query results don't match some chart types) The query mode (basic or advanced) Area chart An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute. The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute. To enable an area chart, add a FACET to your query. You can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the TIMESERIES function when you use a FACET in an NRQL query. Use an area chart when you want to View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify. Avoid an area chart when you want to View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The line chart type is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The bar chart type gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose. Bar chart The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results. The bar chart compares a related set of values. To enable a bar chart, add a FACET clause to the query. You can use FACET with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas. Use a bar chart when you want to Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category. Avoid a bar chart when you want to Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type is not available when using a TIMESERIES clause. The line chart type is a good option for this visualization. Billboard The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView since 1 day ago Copy A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the Apdex function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance. Billboards can also be used to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames. The billboard chart displays a single value in a large, easy to read font. To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown. You can set Warning and Critical thresholds on billboards, which will highlight a chart in yellow or red. The threshold fields are on the right side of the chart edit pane, highlighted in yellow and red respectively. If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the Warning threshold higher than the Critical threshold. Tip Threshold fields will only be available for dashboards that present a single value. For instance, the use of a COMPARE WITH clause will disable the threshold settings in the edit pane. Use a billboard chart when you want to Monitor values, including thresholds for Critical and Warning states, in a large, easy-to-read font. Avoid a billboard chart type when You want to view data over a period of time. The line chart type is a better option for viewing data by time. Bullet chart Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit. Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the Limit field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly. Tip The bullet chart type can only be used for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using COMPARE WITH will not list bullet as an option. Use a bullet chart when you want to View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly. Avoid a bullet chart when you want to View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance. Funnel Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data types that make up the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?” Sample funnel chart for a shopping site. In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them: Browsed the products. Then added one or more products to a shopping cart. And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart. Unlike other queries, you must use a SELECT funnel() statement in your query; the funnel chart type is not selectable from any other type of query. Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON. SELECT funnel(session, WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse ', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased') FROM PageView where appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Use a funnel when you want to You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page. Avoid a funnel when you want to You only want counts for the attributes in the WHERE clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use SELECT funnel in your query. Heat map The heat map displays data in a tabular format using color gradations to show frequency in specific time buckets. The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed. To enable a heat map, use the Histogram() function with a numeric attribute and use FACET to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a heat map when you want to View tabular data for multiple attributes over a period of time, with gradated colors instead of numerals. Avoid a heat map when you want to View the exact data for multiple attributes over a period of time. A line or bar chart may be an option. Histogram A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges. Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a histogram when you want to Chart frequency of data over a series of values. Avoid a histogram when you want to View the same data as heat map or to view the data without the time buckets. JSON Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use remote queries to return raw JSON as a service. To use this, select the Share menu and click Copy JSON. Example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction WHERE httpResponseCode = '200' TIMESERIES FACET appName LIMIT 10 SINCE 24 hours ago Copy Example JSON response: { \"metadata\": { \"contents\": { \"messages\": [], \"timeSeries\": { \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"uniquecount\", \"attribute\": \"name\", \"simple\": true } ] }, \"bucketSizeMillis\": 1800000 }, \"eventTypes\": [ \"Transaction\" ], \"eventType\": \"Transaction\", \"openEnded\": true, \"messages\": [], \"beginTimeMillis\": 1556226069396, \"endTimeMillis\": 1556312469396, \"beginTime\": \"2019-04-25T21:01:09Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-04-26T21:01:09Z\", \"guid\": \"5238a2c6-328d-a5ff-9185-7f3f04c42d1e\", \"routerGuid\": \"1aea2ec5-0be8-3a60-7554-851e1b016eb0\", \"rawSince\": \"24 HOURS AGO\", \"rawUntil\": \"NOW\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"facet\": \"appName\", \"offset\": 0, \"limit\": 10 }, \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"RPM Combined Production\", \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"timeSeries\": [ { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 415 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556226069, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556227869, \"inspectedCount\": 4589471 }, [ { \"uniqueCount\": 1714 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556310669, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556312469, \"inspectedCount\": 53341469 } ], \"total\": { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 2651 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"inspectedCount\": 5053841114 } }, \"performanceStats\": { \"inspectedCount\": 6088068932, \"responseTime\": 8077 } } ... Copy Line A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time. The line chart plots a timeseries for an attribute. When working in basic query mode, select a single attribute you can plot over time. When using NRQL, SELECT one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the TIMESERIES function. Use a line chart when you want to Create a chart that lets you easily view trends over a specified time frame. Avoid a line chart when you want to View your data using one or more attributes and see the values associated with each attribute. A bar or table chart is an option. Pie chart A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the FACET clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes. The pie chart maps a set of values as a portion of a whole. To enable pie chart, add a FACET from the dropdown. You can add only one FACET in basic query mode. If you're using NRQL, you can use FACET to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the TIMESERIES function. Pie charts are unavailable for the following aggregator functions: average, apdex, min, max, percentage, and percentile. For uniqueCount, percentages may add up to more than 100%. Use a pie chart when you want to Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example. Avoid a pie chart when you want to Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts. Pie chart percentage problem When using a pie chart with the uniqueCount aggregator function, the percentages can add up to more than 100%. This is because the attributes being uniquely counted may be present in multiple facets. For example, in the query SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView FACET appName, a single unique user may use multiple apps. Each of these users are included in the unique value for each of the appropriate facets (apps), but the total number of unique users won't change. To solve this, use a bar chart or table to provide a more accurate visualization of uniqueCount data. Table A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column. If you are using the FACET clause, the results will normally be returned as a table. Other features of tables: You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry takes you to an existing dashboard filtered by that attribute. You can export a table chart to a CSV file. Details on this functionality: If a filter is applied to a dashboard, the download will only include the subset of data based on the filter. If a specific fixed time range is selected, the CSV includes the data for that time period. If you query with multiple attributes, the export includes columns for all FACETs in the query. For charts with a time range dependent on the present moment (for example, since 30 minutes ago), the data in the CSV is generated from the present moment, not from when the chart was initially generated. The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as sharing the data for use in reports, for example. Use a table when you want to Create a text-compatible table consisting of your data. This table can be shared and used in reports or imported into spreadsheets, for example. Avoid a table when you want to View your data in a graphical format.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Imagine you've developed a website and instrumented it with New Relic's Browser monitoring. New Relic's core feature set provides a lot of information, but you want something custom. You want to decide if a new design for your site will better engage your users. In other words, you want to A/B test a design and make a decision based on the data. For this task, you could create a New Relic One application, using React, the New Relic One software development kit, and the limitless power of modern web technologies. New Relic One applications are built with one of web development's most popular JavaScript libraries: React. Because you have freedom when writing React code, you can customize your app logic, design your own components, or take advantage of the abundance of open source component libraries. So, for your A/B test app, if you want to write custom logic to end the test based on results, you can do so. The New Relic One software development kit (SDK) allows you to create, serve, publish, and deploy applications to New Relic One. It also provides a host of React components for gathering data, presenting information, handling user interactions, and more. You use components like Button and Dropdown to create an interactive experience that looks and feels native to New Relic. You use Table and Chart components to display data from your New Relic account or elsewhere. When building your A/B test application, you'd use the SDK's NrqlQuery component to fetch Browser data from your account. With custom React code, SDK components, and the wide world of open source libraries, you can create your A/B test application in New Relic One. But before you create one for yourself, you might want to check the app catalog to see if someone has beaten you to it! If the catalog already had an app for that, you could add it to your account with a couple clicks, another benefit of creating apps in New Relic One. Throughout this course, you’re going to build a real-world New Relic One application for running and managing A/B tests. You’ll visualize Browser data for your competing designs, see historical data from past tests, and even choose a winning design and end the test, all from your New Relic One application! But before you get into the weeds of building charts and making http requests, you need to learn what New Relic One applications are made of.

It also makes use of newrelic_telemetry_sdk to send telemetry data to New Relic. A simulator service that generates dummy database traffic so you don't have to manually perform CRUD operations To spin up these services, you first need to set NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY environment variable. Prepare your environment On your local machine, set your license key in an environment variable: bash Copy $ export NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Your mock database uses this key to write telemetry data to New Relic.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding access to our time picker in the sample transaction overview application. The sample application provides an overview of the telemetry data showing your account's transactions by application, average response time, HTTP response codes, and transaction errors. When you enable the time picker, users can specify the time range of data to view. We also have a 12 minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/add-time-picker Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Important If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the platformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(platformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Important You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Important You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the platformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Important This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the platformState */ console.log(platformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add version descriptions.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Advanced math functions NRQL includes advanced mathematical functions that can be used for complex calculations and for processing data to display more effectively in the UI. abs abs(n) returns the absolute value of n. For non-negative n it returns n, and for negative n it returns the positive number -n. For example abs(2) = 2, and abs(-4) = 4. round, floor, ceil(ing) These three functions force decimal numbers to one of the neighboring integers. floor(n) returns the closest integer less than or equal to n. ceil(n) returns the closest integer greater than or equal to n. round(n) returns the closest integer to n in either direction. Sample graph showing raw data, with floor, round, and ceiling functions applied. clamp_max, clamp_min The clamping functions impose an upper or lower bound on values. For example, clamp_max(duration, 10) returns the duration, unless it exceeds 10, in which case 10 is returned. Similarly clamp_min(duration, 1) will not return any value lower than 1. The following chart shows the result of clamping both min and max to keep the value in the range 70-90. Sample graph showing raw data with clamp function applied. pow pow(n, m) computes n raised to the power m. (I.e. n * n * ... * n, with m copies of n) sqrt sqrt(n) returns the square root of n, that is, the number such that sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n. exp Computes the natural exponential function of the argument: exp(n) = pow(e, n). ln, log2, log10, log These functions compute the logarithm of the argument for various bases. ln(n) computes the natural logarithm: the logarithm base e. log2(n) computes the logarithm base 2. log10(n) computes the logarithm base 10. log(n, b) allows logarithms to be computed with an arbitrary base b. All logarithms satisfy the identity: log(pow(b, n), b) = n. Note that log(0) is undefined, for all bases. Be aware that if you take the logarithm of something that might be zero, you may end up getting No Value back from your query.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a section to end your test, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you created a section of your application that allows you to pick the most effective design from your A/B test. The goal of this section is to end the test once you’ve selected a winner: When you select a version from this form, the selection does not persist in the Select component. Now, it’s time to implement that behavior. Step 1 of 11 Change to the persist-selected-version/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test Step 2 of 11 In end-test.js, initialize EndTestSection.state with a default selectedVersion field: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 3 of 11 Pass the selectedVersion, as a prop, to VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 4 of 11 Supply the selectedVersion to your Select component in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 5 of 11 Create a method, selectVersion(), that updates EndTestSection.state: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy You must bind selectVersion to the EndTestSection component so it can access state. Step 6 of 11 Pass the method to VersionSelector as a prop: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 7 of 11 Set selectVersion as the onChange callback in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 8 of 11 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test. Step 9 of 11 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 10 of 11 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 11 of 11 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

      "body": "Original pricing plan This doc is for users on our original user model. Overview For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM. These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our original user model. Single Sign On (SSO) allows a computer user to log in to multiple systems via a single portal. If you are a New Relic account Owner setting up SSO integration for your organization, you must obtain a SAML certificate that identifies the SSO login URL (and possibly logout URL) for your organization. The other types of information required for SSO integration will vary depending on the SAML service provider being used. Requirements Requirements include: These docs apply for managing users on our original user model. For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see Authentication domains. Access to this feature requires Pro or Enterprise edition. Owner role required SSO settings UI page To find the New Relic SSO settings page: from the account dropdown, click Account settings, then click Security and authentication, then click Single sign on. If you don't see this UI, review the requirements. Providers supported by New Relic For a list of the SAML service providers that New Relic currently supports for SSO integration: From the New Relic title bar, select (account dropdown) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. Providers include: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 SAML information in New Relic account To integrate with an SAML provider, the provider will need information from you about your New Relic account. Most of the information you will need is visible on the New Relic SSO settings UI page: Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message SAML version: 2.0 Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize) Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST NameID format: Email address Attributes: None required Entity ID: Account URL (default of rpm.newrelic.com) New Relic SAML requirements For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page. Plan for users who no longer need access Typically manual deletion by the account Owner or Administrator. Clock synchronization Ensure the SAML identity provider clocks are maintained by NTP. More SAML SSO procedures Here are some important procedures for managing SAML SSO for users on our original user model: Set up SAML SSO After obtaining your SAML identity provider certificate, which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the Single Sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a customer partnership, access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Parent and child accounts If your account has child accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the parent account level only. The child account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the parent account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the custom entity ID feature. Configure SSO To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes. To set up your SSO configuration for users on our original user model: Read about an option to have users bypass SAML SSO if they use domains you own. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select Choose file, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Specify the Remote login URL that your users will use for single sign on. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save your changes. Tip If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default. Test SSO After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the Test page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results. To go back and change your configuration settings, select 1 CONFIGURE. Enable SSO When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy Single Sign On with New Relic. As an additional security measure, users cannot sign in until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Add a logout URL for session timeouts New Relic's Session configuration feature requires a logout URL for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner. In addition, if you are the account Owner, New Relic automatically provides a link from Session configuration to go directly to SAML Single Sign On and add a logout URL. Important The logout URL cannot contain newrelic.com anywhere in the URL. The Session configuration feature also includes the option to select an automatic timeout for SAML-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated. Add users to SAML accounts For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM. As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) won't receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users on our original user model that are authenticating via SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization. To flag your account as owning one or more domain names, get support at support.newrelic.com. SAML for multiple accounts In the SAML protocol, the entity ID uniquely identifies the service provider (New Relic) to your SAML provider. New Relic's default entity ID is rpm.newrelic.com. This is sufficient if you have only a single SAML-enabled account. When you configure multiple New Relic accounts with SAML, your SAML provider typically requires each account to have a unique entity ID. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities, use New Relic's custom entity ID feature. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Select custom entity IDs New Relic's custom entity ID feature allows you to enable a unique entity ID for each of your accounts. You can then configure SAML SSO for them as a distinct application with your SAML provider. This allows you to centrally control user authentication to each of your accounts independently. To select custom entity IDs: Follow standard procedures to set up SSO. In addition, from the Entity ID row on the Step 1. Configure page, select Use custom entity ID. Important You must use the same entity ID to configure the application's setting with your SAML provider. Some SAML providers require you to create a new application configuration when changing the entity ID. Maintain SSO settings After your SAML SSO login is configured, tested, and enabled, all of your New Relic account users (including the account Owner and Admins) must use your organization's SSO URL to sign in to New Relic. Their email address must match what has been set up in New Relic. Also, their ability to use the SSO URL to access applications other than New Relic will depend on their permissions set in those applications. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Update SAML SSO info To update SAML SSO information for users on our original user model: Sign in to New Relic by using your SAML SSO login URL. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. To temporarily turn off the SAML integration with New Relic and update your settings, select Disable SAML login. Optional: To change your existing SAML certificate, select Choose file. Follow standard procedures to select and save the file, then save. Optional: To change your existing SSO URLs, copy and paste in (or type) the Remote login URL or Logout landing URL, then save. Email addresses Tip Owner or Admins Account Owners or Admins must ensure that users' email addresses to sign in to New Relic match their SSO email. Account Owners, Admins and users cannot update email addresses on SAML authenticated accounts. To update user information for your organization's New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. From the Users list, select any of the options to add new users, edit existing users' roles, or delete them. Troubleshoot SSO login No one using the account, including the Owner and Admins, can sign in to New Relic directly. If you get locked out of SSO and need to disable it or change the configuration, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete SSO configuration For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Caution If you delete your SAML SSO integration with New Relic, you cannot restore it. However, you can follow standard procedures to set up your configuration again. For users on our original user model, here's how to delete your SAML SSO configuration completely: Sign in to New Relic by using your SAML SSO login URL. From the New Relic menu bar, select: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign-on. Select Delete SAML Configuration. At the confirmation prompt, select OK. Partners and SAML SSO With partnership accounts, authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. For accounts where the partnership supports SSO, users may access their New Relic UI without reauthenticating. These Partner accounts could use SAML SSO as an alternative secure method to sign in to the New Relic site. Other Partner accounts, including Heroku, AppDirect, and Microsoft Azure, do not permit direct login to New Relic. In this situation, SAML integration from the partner's site is not supported by the partner SSO. If you have questions, contact your partner representative at New Relic. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Example Your account structure and settings affect whether SAML is available and how it applies to your accounts. This example shows the hierarchy for New Relic Partner accounts with parent accounts and child accounts. Here is an example of how accounts and child accounts inherit the SAML SSO configuration. Account level SAML SSO configuration Partnership The partnership level allows you to control whether accounts under the partnership can have SAML enabled. The partnership account's Owner has certain administrative functions, but a SAML configuration on this account is not inherited by other accounts in the partnership. Parent accounts Parent accounts (also referred to as master accounts) have a direct, hierarchical relationship to one or more child accounts. Typically the SAML configuration on a parent account is inherited automatically by all of its child accounts. Child accounts Child accounts (also known as sub-accounts) inherit their SAML SSO configuration from their parent account when the parent account has SAML configured. If the parent account does not have SAML configured, each child account may have its own configuration. For more information, see Configuring SAML with multiple accounts.",

Before you build your New Relic One application, you need to spin up your demo services. This coursework depends on two important services: A web service that shows a newsletter signup form. The form's heading text alternates between two versions because you're performing an A/B test to determine which text leads to more high-quality subscriptions. A simulator service that sends steady traffic to the website so that you don't have to manually generate data To spin up your demo services, you first need to install Docker and Docker compose. Spin up your demo services Step 1 of 5 Clone the coursework repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course This repository contains code for creating NodeJS New Relic automations. It also contains a an app code directory for each lesson in the course. You'll use these directories to follow along with the course content. Step 2 of 5 Change to the demo directory, called ab-test-app: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/ab-test-app This directory contains configuration files and READMEs for using the demo. Step 3 of 5 Build and run the web service and simulator containers, using docker-compose: bash Copy $ NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<your New Relic license key> docker-compose up -d Important Make sure you replace <your New Relic license key> with your actual license key. Once it's finished, view the website at localhost:3001: Step 4 of 5 Visit New Relic, and navigate to APM in the top navigation menu. Select Newsletter from the list of instrumented services: You may have to wait a minute or two for New Relic to recieve data from your demo services. Once it's ready, you'll see transaction data, such as performance, throughput, and an Apdex score: Step 5 of 5 To spin down your demo services, run docker-compose down from your ab-test-app directory: bash Copy $ docker-compose down Now you're ready to build your New Relic One application!

      "body": "One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the Apps page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet Nerdpack item inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

      "body": "Our .NET agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. Install overview The install instructions in this document are for a standard .NET agent installation on Windows. However, some setups have specific caveats and instructions, which you should read first: ASP.NET Core Azure install NuGet install Docker container install Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Apps not hosted in IIS The latest version of the .NET agent supports .NET Framework 4.5 and higher. If you have legacy applications you wish to monitor, see support for earlier .NET Framework versions. Install the agent for IIS applications with our guided install Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the .NET agent for Windows IIS applications. First, you need a New Relic account (It's free, forever!). Then, start the appropriate guided install. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, use the EU Guided install. Get an account Guided install EU guided install In addition to the .NET agent, you can use the CLI to install and use our infrastructure agent to discover other applications, infrastructure, and log sources running in your environment and recommend which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Download and install the agent To install the .NET agent: Ensure you have admin rights for your Windows admin group. For more on this, see permissions documentation. Download the installer that matches your system architecture: 64-bit 32-bit Run the install wizard. Tips for using the install wizard: When prompted, input your New Relic license key. Consider leaving Instrument all disabled if you will only be monitoring applications hosted with IIS. Otherwise, enable Instrument all and follow additional instructions to enable the agent for your application. If you are changing an existing installation using the install wizard, select the Change option. Optional: you can also run the installer via the command line or from a script. This can be useful for automating your agent install. For each application you wish to monitor, give your application a meaningful name. Make sure to review the steps on Name your .NET application for information on setting your app name. If your application is short-lived (existing for less than 60 seconds), it will require configuration or it won't report data. Restart affected applications. If using IIS, restart IIS. If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see No data appears. Run MSI via command line or from a script Important This section describes a command-line alternative to the standard install procedure. Instead of using the MSI install wizard, you can run the MSI from the command line or from a script. This can be useful for automating your agent install. Here is the command to perform a new agent install using the MSI installer. (For changes to an existing installation, use the ADDLOCAL command.) Replace the highlighted sections with relevant values. msiexec.exe /i C:\\PATH_TO\\newrelic-agent-win-x86-VERSION.msi /qb NR_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY INSTALLLEVEL=1 Copy The INSTALLLEVEL can be either 1 or 50: 1: Installs .NET agent with default options (described in table below). If your application is not hosted on IIS or uses IIS as a reverse proxy, you should use option 50. 50: Installs the agent with InstrumentAllNETFramework enabled (described below). Instead of using the INSTALLLEVEL presets, you can customize which features to install with the ADDLOCAL command shown below. This is also the command you'd use to update an existing installation. msiexec.exe /i C:\\PATH_TO\\newrelic-agent-win-x86-VERSION.msi /qb NR_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY ADDLOCAL=OPTION_1, OPTION_2 Copy Available options are: Option Details NETFrameworkSupport Enabled by default. This identifies the registry keys used to attach the .NET profiler to a .NET Framework application. Without this, our .NET agent won't work for an IIS-hosted .NET Framework app. NETCoreSupport Enabled by default. This identifies the registry keys used to attach the .NET profiler to a .NET Core application. Without this, the .NET agent will not work for an IIS-hosted .NET Core app. InstrumentAllNETFramework This will result in all .NET Framework applications being instrumented by setting global environment variables. This setting is the equivalent of selecting Instrument all in the MSI install wizard. StartMenuShortcuts Enabled by default. Adds several useful shortcuts to your start menu. ASPNETTools Enabled by default. Adds the ASP.NET cache flush tool which, when run, clears out some .NET temporary files and restarts IIS. Enable the agent for apps not in IIS If the application you want to monitor is not hosted in IIS, you will follow the standard install procedure but in addition you must explicitly enable the agent for that application. Enabling the agent differs for .NET Framework and .NET Core applications. When following the standard install procedure, we recommend that you enable Instrument all. Enable for .NET Framework Enable the agent for your application with one of the following methods: Enable via application config file In the application's config file, add a new appSetting with a key named NewRelic.AgentEnabled and a value of true. For example, if the application name is DataServices.exe, edit DataServices.exe.config to: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"true\" /> <add key=\"NewRelic.AppName\" value=\"DataServices\" /> </appSettings> Copy Enable by app name via newrelic.config (global or local) You can use the newrelic.config file (either global or local), to choose what applications to monitor. In the configuration file, add an instrumentation element with a child application element for each application. In the instrumentation element, provide the base file name, with extension, you want to instrument (for example, <application name=\"DataServices.exe\" />). For example: <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"BusinessLogicServices.exe\" /> <application name=\"DataServices.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file You can use a local newrelic.config file to monitor an application: Place the newrelic.config file in the directory containing the application's executable file. Set the agentEnabled attribute to true. For example: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\"> Copy Enable for .NET Core For .NET Core, you must configure your application to be monitored by setting the following environment variable: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 Copy We recommend setting the environment variables for each application you want to instrument. If you set them globally, you might instrument .NET processes other than your apps. Tip Here are a few ways you can set this environment variable per process, rather than system-wide.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart headings, before starting this one. With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import VersionDescription, create descriptions for each design version, and create a new GridItem component for each design version: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you've created two VersionDescription components. You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test.

In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course.

Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to set users to basic. Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to set users to basic. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test.

This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the PieChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts.

      "body": "Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User. For more information on the various NerdStorage components, please visit the New Relic developer website API documentation.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Tip In case you want to enable REMOTE_MONITORING, you need to change your localhost when granting permisions by the server from where you want to monitor the MySQL instance. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the MysqlSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The MySQL integration collects the following metrics: Default metrics These metrics are captured by default: Name Description cluster.slaveRunning Boolean. 1 if this server is a replication slave that is connected to a replication master, and both the I/O and SQL threads are running; otherwise, it is 0.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"categoryTerms\": [\"browser agent\"], \"keywords\": [\"a/b test\"], \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the Instant Observability category in which to place the app, search keywords, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog metadata. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Publish your New Relic One application.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Or, if you report data to the EU data center go to one.eu.newrelic.com. Tip Learn more about New Relic One’s basic UI features. Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Query your data more easily On the Browse data menu on the top navigation menu you can easily access your basic telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces). Wherever you go in the UI, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Build NRQL and PROMQL-like queries. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. New Relic One dashboards let you build better visualizations more easily, with more options to customize.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development.

Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

The New Relic One application that you're building throughout this course allows developers to A/B test their websites. To run a successful A/B test, site owners need to be able to analyze the results. Without knowing how each design performs, how will developers determine which design to use? Here is a mockup for the A/B test application you're building: Your application displays data for two competing versions. With various charts and tables, your users will be able to analyze the results of their test and make informed decisions on which design will work best to achieve their goals. You’ll refer back to this mockup many times throughout this course. It shows you what charts to create, how to organize them, and what kind of data to provide them. In the next four sections, you learn how to create every chart that your A/B test application needs to operate effectively.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ?

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost.

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring.

You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack items, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

      "body": "One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the Apps page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"categoryTerms\": [\"browser agent\"], \"keywords\": [\"a/b test\"], \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the Instant Observability category in which to place the app, search keywords, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog metadata. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart components to your A/B test application, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-your-first-chart/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named newsletter-signups.js: bash Copy $ touch newsletter-signups.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called NewsletterSignups to hold your first LineChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Here, you’ve created two arbitrary data series which represent versions A and B of your test. Right now, you're using manually-crafted data points. In the future, you'll replace these with data queried from New Relic. Notice that you’ve specified a color for each series in the chart. The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In seven steps, you’ve breathed life into your New Relic One application. Instead of a bland “Hello world” message, your application now shows a colorful line chart with two mocked data series. These data series represent server-side traffic for each of the competing designs in your demo website. In the next lesson, you’ll build on this foundation by creating another chart type.

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=true: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages. Reduce data ingest Our charts support setting an option to reduce the amount of data ingest at the cost of dropping detailed information. To enable it, set global.lowDataMode=true in the nri-bundle chart. lowDataMode affects three specific components of the nri-bundle chart outlined below. Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration If lowDataMode is enabled, the following metrics are excluded by default as they are already collected and used by the New Relic Kubernetes Integration. - kube_ - container_ - machine_ - cadvisor_ Copy New Relic Logging If lowDataMode is enabled, Labels and Annotations are set to Off in the Filter section of the fluent-bit.conf file. This means that this detail will be dropped from the container log files which reduces the overall data ingest into New Relic. The following fields are retained: Allowlist_key container_name Allowlist_key namespace_name Allowlist_key pod_name Allowlist_key stream Allowlist_key log Copy Low Data Mode Log Example Complete Log Record [ { \"cluster_name\": \"api-test\", \"kubernetes\": { \"annotations\": { \"kubernetes.io/psp\": \"eks.privileged\" }, \"container_hash\": \"fryckbos/test@sha256:5b098eaf3c7d5b3585eb10cebee63665b6208bea31ef31a3f0856c5ffdda644b\", \"container_image\": \"fryckbos/test:latest\", \"container_name\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"docker_id\": \"134e1daf63761baa15e035b08b7aea04518a0f0e50af4215131a50c6a379a072\", \"host\": \"ip-192-168-17-123.ec2.internal\", \"labels\": { \"app\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"app.kubernetes.io/name\": \"newrelic-logging\", \"controller-revision-hash\": \"84db95db86\", \"pod-template-generation\": \"1\", \"release\": \"nri-bundle\" }, \"namespace_name\": \"nrlogs\", \"pod_id\": \"54556e3e-719c-46b5-af69-020b75d69bf1\", \"pod_name\": \"nri-bundle-newrelic-logging-jxnbj\" }, \"message\": \"[2021/09/14 12:30:49] [ info] [engine] started (pid=1)\\n\", \"plugin\": { \"source\": \"kubernetes\", \"type\": \"fluent-bit\", \"version\": \"1.8.1\" }, \"stream\": \"stderr\", \"time\": \"2021-09-14T12:30:49.138824971Z\", \"timestamp\": 1631622649138 } ] Copy Log Record after enabling lowDataMode.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"categoryTerms\": [\"browser agent\"], \"keywords\": [\"a/b test\"], \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the Instant Observability category in which to place the app, search keywords, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog metadata. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

To run a successful A/B test, site owners need to be able to analyze the results. Without knowing how each design performs, how will developers determine which design to use? Here is a mockup for the A/B test application you're building: Your application displays data for two competing versions. With various charts and tables, your users will be able to analyze the results of their test and make informed decisions on which design will work best to achieve their goals. You’ll refer back to this mockup many times throughout this course. It shows you what charts to create, how to organize them, and what kind of data to provide them. In the next four sections, you learn how to create every chart that your A/B test application needs to operate effectively. After that, you’ll arrange the charts to match the mockup’s design and supply New Relic data collected from the demo applications you spun up earlier. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add your first chart.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the PieChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add tables.",

To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. NRQL queries made through NerdGraph are subject to NRQL Query Rate Limits. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

This document contains: How to view and query your metrics Example metric queries How to query multiple metrics with wildcards How to explore metric data Query APM metric timeslice data APM reports a specific type of data that we call metric timeslice data. For how to query that, see Query metric timeslice data. For information about other types of metrics, see Metric data types. View and query your metrics You can use NRQL to query your metric data in the New Relic One query builder or using our NerdGraph API. To query a metric, use the following query format: FROM Metric SELECT function(metric_name) WHERE attribute=value FACET attribute TIMESERIES Copy Below are the functions supported for each metric type: Metric type Supported functions Summary count, sum, min, max, and average Count sum Gauge count, sum, min, max, average, and latest Add the names of the metrics you want to chart with the appropriate value functions in the SELECT clause. The WHERE and FACET clauses can be used with attribute values. Remember to include the keyword TIMESERIES if you want to chart the data. This example demonstrates how you could chart the CPU usage in seconds for cluster foo . This query breaks down CPU usage by container, given a count metric named container_cpu_usage_seconds_total with the attributes containerName and clusterName: FROM Metric select sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total) WHERE clusterName = 'foo' FACET containerName TIMESERIES Copy If you want the CPU usage per minute (the rate of change), then you can add the rate function to the query above. FROM Metric select rate(sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total), 1 minute) WHERE clusterName = 'foo' FACET containerName TIMESERIES Copy View example metric queries The previous examples demonstrate basic forms of metric queries, but NRQL can also be used to chart, explore, and analyze metric data. Chart multiple metrics Chart multiple metrics using a single query by providing a comma-separated list of metrics in the SELECT clause. For example, to chart the memory usage for a container along with the memory limit metric, use the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes), latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) WHERE containerName = 'inventory' TIMESERIES Copy You can also do this using wildcards, as explained below. Perform mathematical operations on metric data Perform math operations on one or more metrics to compute a new, derived metric. To monitor available memory, you can calculate the percentage of available memory from the two metrics used in the previous example: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(container_memory_usage_bytes)) / latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) * 100 AS '% Memory Available' WHERE containerName = 'inventory' TIMESERIES Copy You can also do this using wildcards, as explained below. Use filters to select specific time series In addition to using a WHERE clause which applies to everything in SELECT, NRQL provides another aggregation function called filter which can be used to select a specific time series to be charted or operated on. The following example charts a memory usage metric labeled \"Total (k8s)\" which is computed by adding together the memory usage of two specific containers within a pod: FROM Metric SELECT filter( latest( container_memory_usage_bytes), WHERE containerName = 'discovery') + filter( latest( container_memory_usage_bytes), WHERE containerName = 'my-proxy') AS 'Total (k8s)' WHERE clusterName = 'my-cluster' AND podName LIKE 'my-pilot-%' TIMESERIES Copy View the raw metric data points When querying metric data using FROM Metric, New Relic automatically selects the specific aggregate to use in the query, depending on the length of the query window and any bucket size specified as an argument to the TIMESERIES keyword. This ensures efficient querying and chart resolution. If you want to override this behavior to view or operate on the raw metric data points, use the optional RAW keyword in your query. When querying these raw metric data points, there is a query time window limit of 48 hours. Any query attempting to access more than 48 hours of raw metric data will result in a query error. This example shows how to list the last 20 data points received for a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE metricName = 'container_fs_usage_bytes' LIMIT 20 RAW Copy Query multiple metrics with wildcards Wildcards are represented in NRQL by the % character. If you want to query multiple metrics that use a standard naming convention, you can use the wildcard feature to return results for all of them without having to specify each metric name individually. Wildcards can help you: Aggregate metrics together and chart the results FACET results by metric name in a chart Find and chart all metrics matching a given naming convention Wildcards are particularly helpful if you later add new metrics matching an existing naming convention. By using % instead of writing out each metric name in your query, you won't have to rewrite the query when you add new metrics. Let's say you have multiple algorithms that perform a similar task. You can define the following metrics, which show the duration of the different algorithms: myNeatProcess.algorithm1.duration myNeatProcess.algorithm2.duration myNeatProcess.algorithm3.duration If used in a query, myNeatProcess.%.duration will return results for all three of the algorithms above. If you later create new algorithms named algorithm4, algorithm5, and algorithm6, the same query will return results for all six algorithms. Chart multiple metrics with wildcards You can chart multiple metrics using a single query by using wildcards (%) in the SELECT clause. For example, to query all the algorithms in the example above and plot a line on the chart for each algorithm's average duration, use the following query: FROM Metric SELECT average(myNeatProcess.%.duration) FACET metricName TIMESERIES Copy Perform mathematical operations on metric data with wildcards You can also use wildcards to perform math operations on multiple metrics and compute a new metric. You can calculate the mean duration for all algorithms listed in the example above: FROM Metric SELECT average(myNeatProcess.%.duration) TIMESERIES Copy You can calculate what percentage of overall runtime a single algorithm takes: FROM Metric SELECT myNeatProcess.algorithm1.duration / sum(myNeatProcess.%.duration) TIMESERIES Copy Return results for invidual fields using getField() Metrics have multiple fields associated with them, and each field contains its own unique values. If you would like to extract one of those values using a query, you can do that with getField(). For example, if you want to use a single value within a metric to do a comparison in a WHERE clause, you can use getField(metricName, field) or metricName[field]. List of gauge metrics This example query returns a list of gauge metrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE %[type] = 'gauge' Copy List all metric names for a particular host The average value of a metric is computed as total over count, so the following query returns metric data where the result of the average() value function is greater than 2. FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE appName = 'MyApp' AND apm.service.transaction.duration[total] / apm.service.transaction.duration[count] > 2 Copy Explore metric data The NRQL keyset and uniques functions can be used together with the metricName attribute (available on all metrics) to perform tasks like listing all the available metrics in your account or discovering the attributes available on a particular metric. List all metric names in an account FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy List all metric names for a particular host FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE hostname = 'host1.mycompany.com' Copy Show the attribute keys for a specific metric FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = METRIC_NAME Copy",

We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path compared to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f previous-manifest-file.yml, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f manifest-file.yml. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see your charts styled and arranged in a grid. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In just six steps, you significantly improved the readability and usability of your A/B test application, but you can take further steps to improve the usability of your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll add headings to your charts to remind yourself of what data each chart presents.

Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data. In the next lesson, you'll replace the mocked data in your charts with real data from your backend service.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server.

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Step 3 of 7 Update your package.json version: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"f2dbc999-e9a3-49b9-933d-5a704c6750bd\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy This allows you to publish a new version of your Nerdpack. Step 4 of 7 Publish your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 5 of 7 Update your whatsNew string in catalog/config.json: documentation.md config.json 1 Enter your first and last name into the fields provided. When you're done, press **Submit** to see a personalized \"Hello!\" message. catalog/documentation.md Copy 1 { 2 \"tagline\": \"Say hi!\", 3 \"details\": \"DemoApp says Hello to a user.\", 4 \"categoryTerms\": [], 5 \"keywords\": [\"hello world\"], 6 \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/developer-website\", 7 \"whatsNew\": \"feat: Add new icons\" 8 } catalog/config.json Copy This will tell users what you added in the latest version of your Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Submit this new metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from demo-app... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app Uploading screenshots from demo-app/launchers/launcher... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/launchers/launcher Uploading screenshots from demo-app/nerdlets/home... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/nerdlets/home ✔ Updated metadata for DemoApp 1.0.1 Step 7 of 7 Go to the catalog and subscribe to your Nerdpack to see your new icon: Resolve issues with submitting catalog information Sometimes, when you work with catalog metadata, you may run into issues. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack Remember that you can only submit catalog metadata for Nerdpacks that have already been published. If you try to submit information for a Nerdpack that hasn't been published, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating DemoApp 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN Resize your images Screenshots for the catalog must meet the criteria specified previously in this guide. If they don't, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 2 errors while updating DemoApp 1.0.1 › › catalog/screenshots/screenshot.png › Invalid Screenshot: screenshot.png has a size ratio of 4:2.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

You'll use your own machine's resources, but you'll see the Nerdpack in the New Relic platform as you would if it were published. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Serve your Nerdpack locally Step 1 of 5 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run the nerdpack:serve command: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you've successfully served your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! While your Nerdpack is being served locally, the server will automatically reload your Nerdpack when it detects that you've modified a file. This doesn't include the metadata file nr1.json or the styles file styles.css. If you update those files, you need to stop your local server with CTRL+C and restart it with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local: New Relic requires the ?nerdpacks=local query string to load locally served Nerdpacks. Step 3 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Whether you're creating a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Apps. Step 4 of 5 If you're serving a Nerdpack with a launcher and a Nerdlet, you'll find your local app under Your apps: If you're serving a Nerdpack with a visualization, go to Favorite apps > Custom Visualizations: Tip If Custom Visualizations isn't favorited, you can find it under Your apps. From Custom Visualizations, you'll see your visualization: Whether you're serving a Nerdpack for an app or a visualization, you'll see a </> Local indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally served Nerdpacks. Step 5 of 5 When you're ready to stop serving your Nerdpack locally, type CTRL+C into your terminal where the server is running. Resolve issues with accessing your local Nerdpack Sometimes, when you serve your Nerdpack locally, you may come across issues. You may be unable to serve your Nerdpack because of bugs in your code. Or, you may successfully serve your Nerdpack but be unable to find it in New Relic. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your application When you attempt to serve your Nerdpack locally, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --verbose Show locally served Nerdpacks If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, make sure you're using the ?nerdpacks=local query string. If you're not, New Relic won't load your locally served Nerdpack on the platform. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you serve your Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:serve, you must be signed into the same profile in New Relic that you're serving with locally. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic and you're using the correct query string, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same. Access your proxy browser Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic. But understanding how it works can help you resolve issues with your local server. When you run nr1 nerdpack:serve, your code is served by your local machine using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and uses a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. To load a Nerdpack into the platform, whether it's locally served or published to the Instant Observability catalog, New Relic uses an <IFRAME> and a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net), relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, you're using the correct query string, and you're using the correct profile, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where <UserId> is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform. You can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it. Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where <NerdpackUuid> is the UUID assigned to your package, and <NerdpackGid> is zero, or a positive integer.

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Step 4 of 4 Publish and subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Now, that your account is subscribed to your visualization, you can describe your app configurations with JSON and add it to a dashboard with NerdGraph. Describe your visualization options with JSON Whether you're adding your visualization to a new dashboard or an existing one, you need to send your configuration to NerdGraph. Your custom visualization JSON object represents a dashboard widget and consists of the following fields: Field Type Description title String Title for your dashboard widget visualization JSON The metadata for your visualization visualization.id String Your visualization's ID rawConfiguration JSON A full configuration of your widget Tip You can also add other types of widgets to dashboards with the steps in this guide, but the fields described here are specific to custom visualization widgets. For other widget types, you need to supply different data. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 5 Start with a JSON template based on the fields you need to describe your custom visualization: { \"title\": \"\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 2 of 5 Give your visualization widget a title: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 3 of 5 Look up your Nerdpack ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack\" } my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json Copy Then, look up your visualization ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy Set your visualization widget's visualization.id to the form {NERDPACK-ID}.{VISUALIZATION-ID}: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 4 of 5 In my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json, review your configuration options: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy The name fields in configuration are important for describing your visualization widget. Step 5 of 5 Using the name field for every configuration object in your visualization's nr1.json file, build a rawConfiguration for your widget: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1234567, \"query\": \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], \"fill\": \"pink\", \"stroke\": \"green\" } } Copy Here, you've created a rawConfiguration by supplying values for each configuration option in nr1.json. Note that nrqlQueries is an array because its type is collection. The other values are strings. Learn more about these configuration options in Configure your custom visualization. Now that you've described your visualization widget in JSON, you can add your configured visualization to a dashboard. In the next section, you'll learn how to create a new dashboard with your visualization. If you already have one ready, skip ahead to add your visualization to your existing dashboard. Create a new dashboard with your visualization If you want to create a new dashboard for your visualization widget, use NerdGraph's dashboardCreate() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardCreate() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description accountId Integer The ID for the account for which you want to create your dashboard dashboard JSON The details of the dashboard you're creating dashboard.name String The name of your dashboard dashboard.permissions Enum: PRIVATE, PUBLIC_READ_ONLY, PUBLIC_READ_WRITE The access control of your dashboard dashboard.pages Array: JSON The details of your dashboard's pages dashboard.pages[].name String The name of the dashboard page dashboard.pages[].widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardCreate() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! In this guide, you create a dashboard with a single page that contains a single widget—the visualization widget you described in the last section. Step 1 of 5 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardCreate(): mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 0, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Here, you've defined the template for a private dashboard. Now, it's time to fill in the details. Step 2 of 5 Look up your account ID and enter it for your accountId: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 3 of 5 Select a name for your dashboard and its page: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 4 of 5 In widgets, place the widget object you created in the last section: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 5 of 5 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) { entityResult { guid } } } Copy Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to create single-page dashboard with a widget for your custom visualization. As a result, you'll see the new dashboard's entity GUID. In the next section, you'll learn how to add your visualization to an existing dashboard. If that's not relevant to your goals, skip ahead to send your request to NerdGraph. Add your visualization to an existing dashboard To add your visualization widget to an existing dashboard, use NerdGraph's dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description guid String The entity GUID for the dashboard to which you're adding your widgets widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 4 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardAddWidgetsToPage(): mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 2 of 4 Look up your dashboard's GUID and enter it for guid: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 3 of 4 In widgets, place the widget object you created in Describe your visualization options with JSON: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) } Copy Step 4 of 4 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to add your custom visualization to an existing dashboard. As a result, you'll see descriptions of any thrown errors to help you debug issues. The last thing you need to do is actually send your request to NerdGraph. Send your request to NerdGraph Send an HTTP request to NerdGraph with the payload you built in previous sections for the mutation that best suits your needs. There are many tools you can use to send an HTTP request, but in this guide, you learn how to communicate with NerdGraph using three specific tools: NerdGraph API explorer cURL New Relic CLI If you use another, you can adapt these methods for your favorite development tool. NerdGraph API explorer The NerdGraph API explorer is an implementation of GraphiQL that lets you explore the NerdGraph APIs. Step 1 of 4 Go to the NerdGraph API explorer. Step 2 of 4 Select or create a new API key: Step 3 of 4 In the center console, paste your mutation query: Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Step 4 of 4 Press Execute Query and see the results in the right pane: If you successfully created a new dashboard, your response has an entity GUID. If you don't have an entity GUID, the response contains error messages to help you debug your query. If you added your visualization to an existing dashboard, you won't see errors in the response. If you do see error messages, use them to debug your query. Explore The NerdGraph API explorer lets you see other fields and change your query without typing everything manually. Use the left pane to explore NerdGraph. cURL cURL is a command line utility for making HTTP requests. Step 1 of 2 Select or create a New Relic user key. Copy this key, because you use it in the next step. Step 2 of 2 Make a request to NerdGraph, using cURL: bash Copy $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: <YOUR-USER-KEY>' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\": \"mutation {dashboardCreate(dashboard: {name: \\\"My Awesome Dashboard\\\", pages: [{name: \\\"One Page to Rule Them All\\\", widgets: [{title: \\\"My Awesome Visualization\\\", visualization: {id: \\\"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\\\"}, rawConfiguration: {nrqlQueries: [{accountId: 3014918, query: \\\"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\\\"}], fill: \\\"pink\\\", stroke: \\\"green\\\"}}]}], permissions: PRIVATE}, accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>) { entityResult { guid }}}\", \"variables\": \"\"}' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Here, you send a request to NerdGraph that has two headers, Content-Type and API-Key, and a binary message body containing one of the mutation queries you built in previous sections. If you prefer to use a UI-based client, like Postman, you can adapt this method to a format that your client supports. New Relic CLI The newrelic is a command line interface for reading and writing New Relic data. Step 1 of 2 If you haven't already, install newrelic by following the first two steps of our Get started with the New Relic CLI guide. Once you've done that, you will have newrelic installed and configured for making NerdGraph requests. Step 2 of 2 Make a NerdGraph request using newrelic nerdgraph query: bash Copy $ newrelic nerdgraph query 'mutation { $ dashboardCreate( $ accountId: 1234567, $ dashboard: { $ name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", $ pages: [ $ { $ name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", $ widgets: [ $ { $ title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", $ visualization: { $ id: \"de0b4768-1504-4818-a898-da7cd14f0bfb.my-awesome-visualization\" $ }, $ rawConfiguration: { $ nrqlQueries: [ $ { $ accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>, $ query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" $ } $ ], $ fill: \"pink\", $ stroke: \"green\" $ } $ } $ ] $ }, $ ], $ permissions: PRIVATE $ } $ ) { $ entityResult { $ guid $ } $ } $ }' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. View your new dashboard Now that you've built a dashboard with NerdGraph, it's time to check your work! Step 1 of 4 Go to New Relic. Step 2 of 4 Navigate to Dashboards: Step 3 of 4 Select your new dashboard: Step 4 of 4 View your dashboard: The dashboard you created has the name you passed in your mutation, \"My Awesome Dashboard\". It also has the configuration you sent in rawConfiguration, from the NRQL data query to the fill and stroke colors. Summary Congratulations! In this guide, you used NerdGraph, New Relic's GraphQL API, to add your custom visualization to a dashboard.",

      "body": "What is MLOps? MLOps stands for machine-learning operations. As more companies invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there's a gap in understanding between the data science teams developing machine-learning models and the DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models. MLOps provides a tool for monitoring and observing the performance and effectiveness of machine-learning models in a production environment. This increases the possibilities for collaboration between data science and DevOps teams, feeding into a continuous process of development, testing, and operational monitoring. The Datarobot integration Datarobot provides tools for deploying your machine-learning models into production. By integrating, Datarobot's integration with New Relic, you'll be able to instrument, analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your machine-learning performance across your entire system. By rigorously observing your capabilities, you'll be able to react quickly to changes in the model's input or output and the relationship between the two. Send your model performance metrics from Datarobot Insights to New Relic and you'll have real-time monitoring for your algorithms. You'll explore your metrics data with user-friendly charts and learn the state of your algorithms at a glance for faster and more efficient troubleshooting. Integrate Datarobot with New Relic First, Datarobot uses a Kafka topic to stream Insights from your machine-learning algorithm's performance metrics. Then, the New Relic connector (another algorithm) transforms the Kafka topic into a metrics data payload for a specific New Relic account. Datarobot uses Kafka and Event Flows to send data to New Relic. With Datarobot’s Event Flows, when a new message is set to your Kafka topic, your configured New Relic connector algorithm gets called. The connector transforms your metrics and sends them to your New Relic account. Connect your Datarobot data to New Relic By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Datarobot machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. Start monitoring your Datarobot event flows with New Relic.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

Step 1 of 3 Import Treemap from recharts: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your visualization. The SegmentedControl and RadarChart are at the top of the view, but if you scroll down, you'll see your new Treemap: Switch between charts with your component's state Use state.selectedChart to determine which chart to show: the RadarChart or the Treemap. Step 1 of 1 Destructure this.state to access selectedChart as a separate constant. Then, compare selectedChart to CHART_TYPES.Radar. If they are the same, render a RadarChart. Otherwise, render a Treemap: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 1 of 7 Update the icon.png in the root of your Nerdpack. This icon is used in the catalog and the Nerdpack's detail page. Step 2 of 7 If you're building a Nerdpack with one or more launchers, update the icon.png in each of your launcher's subfolders. Step 3 of 7 Update your package.json version: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"f2dbc999-e9a3-49b9-933d-5a704c6750bd\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy This allows you to publish a new version of your Nerdpack.

Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack Remember that you can only submit catalog metadata for Nerdpacks that have already been published. If you try to submit information for a Nerdpack that hasn't been published, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating DemoApp 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN Resize your images Screenshots for the catalog must meet the criteria specified previously in this guide.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application.

Full users If you're a full user in the New Relic One user model, you either: Have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege Don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to your Nerdpack, an admin must grant you the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege. Tip The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is included in both the User and Admin groups, the only groups available by default. So in most cases, you'll have the ability to manage Nerdpacks as a full user. However, if you're a full user assigned to a custom group that doesn't include the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you won't be able to manage Nerdpacks. Master/Sub-account Capabilities Some accounts, called master accounts, have sub-accounts that report data back up to them. This organizational hierarchy affects Nerdpack capabilities. In general, the flow of control moves downstream: In this example scenario A, the master account publishes a Nerdpack. This means that all three accounts, Master, Account 1, and Account 2, can subscribe to it. If you subscribe the master account to the Nerdpack, then users of all three accounts can use it. If you subscribe Account 1 to it, only Account 1 users can use it, because neither Master nor Account 2 is downstream in the hierarchy. In scenario B, the sub-account, Account 1, publishes a Nerdpack, so you can't use or subscribe to the Nerdpack from Master or Account 2.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"categoryTerms\": [\"browser agent\"], \"keywords\": [\"a/b test\"], \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the Instant Observability category in which to place the app, search keywords, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog metadata. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic.

Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task.

Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { historicalData.data.push({ endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, }) }, data ) return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data and format it according to the TableChart specifications. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. (Note that Request is deprecated, but these options still apply.) Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. We recommend using SSL to avoid exposing plain text credentials in your headers. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(duration)%20FROM%20Transaction', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions.

Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "body": "You can use the New Relic NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to make New Relic Query Language (NRQL) queries. To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. NRQL queries made through NerdGraph are subject to NRQL Query Rate Limits. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API.",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API. Insights API operation NerdGraph API query/mutation Notes List (GET) entitySearch() View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter. Show (GET) entity() View an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Create (POST) dashboardCreate() Create a new dashboard. Update (PUT) dashboardUpdate() Update an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Delete (DELETE) dashboardDelete() Delete an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Dashboard properties mapping table For more information about all the fields in the new dashboards GraphQL schema, have a look at NerdGraph's GraphiQL explorer.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel.

Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV.

If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To publish your Nerdpack and update its catalog information, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can update their catalog information. Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata After you've published your Nerdpack to the Instant Observability catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations. Step 1 of 9 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 9 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 9 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice that there is no information on the Instant Observability or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in nr1.json: There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. For these, you need to provide catalog information to your Nerdpack. Step 4 of 9 From the root of your Nerdpack, create catalog directories to house your Nerdpack's screenshots and metadata: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ created: launchers/launcher/catalog ✔ created: nerdlets/home/catalog ✔ catalog created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" Inside your root catalog directory, you'll find specific files and directories for portraying information about your Nerdpack to your users: bash Copy $ ls catalog README.md additionalInfo.md config.json documentation.md screenshots File Description README.md A markdown file that instructs you how to use the information and metadata in catalog config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application.

Step 1 of 7 Update the icon.png in the root of your Nerdpack. This icon is used in the catalog and the Nerdpack's detail page. Step 2 of 7 If you're building a Nerdpack with one or more launchers, update the icon.png in each of your launcher's subfolders. Step 3 of 7 Update your package.json version: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"f2dbc999-e9a3-49b9-933d-5a704c6750bd\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy This allows you to publish a new version of your Nerdpack.

Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack Remember that you can only submit catalog metadata for Nerdpacks that have already been published. If you try to submit information for a Nerdpack that hasn't been published, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating DemoApp 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN Resize your images Screenshots for the catalog must meet the criteria specified previously in this guide.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"categoryTerms\": [\"browser agent\"], \"keywords\": [\"a/b test\"], \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the Instant Observability category in which to place the app, search keywords, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog metadata. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Create a Nerdpack, before starting this one. When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring! Step 2 of 4 Navigate to the provided url. From the home page, select Apps to view New Relic One applications: Step 3 of 4 Under the Your apps section, find your launcher, called \"A/B Test Launcher\": Step 4 of 4 Select your launcher to see your root Nerdlet and its default welcome message: Tip Here, you've seen how to access your Nerdlet from a launcher. If you want your Nerdlet closer to your data, you can also attach your Nerdlet to New Relic entities. Congratulations, you've served your first New Relic One application! Notice, in the command's output, that the server reloads when you change files in your Nerdpack. Give it a try by updating nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>A/B test results</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your app automatically refreshes to show the new heading: Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

Step 8 of 9 Submit the information to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from demo-app... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app Uploading screenshots from demo-app/launchers/launcher... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/launchers/launcher Uploading screenshots from demo-app/nerdlets/home... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/nerdlets/home ✔ Updated metadata for DemoApp 1.0.0 Step 9 of 9 Go to Instant Observability to see your changes: Click your Nerdpack to see the new details: Update your Nerdpack's icons Within a Nerdpack, you can set two types of icons: One for your entire Nerdpack, which represents your Nerdpack in the catalog One for each of your launchers, which represents your Nerdlets Replace these icons and publish your Nerdpack to see the changes. Step 1 of 7 Update the icon.png in the root of your Nerdpack. This icon is used in the catalog and the Nerdpack's detail page. Step 2 of 7 If you're building a Nerdpack with one or more launchers, update the icon.png in each of your launcher's subfolders. Step 3 of 7 Update your package.json version: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"f2dbc999-e9a3-49b9-933d-5a704c6750bd\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy This allows you to publish a new version of your Nerdpack. Step 4 of 7 Publish your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 5 of 7 Update your whatsNew string in catalog/config.json: documentation.md config.json 1 Enter your first and last name into the fields provided. When you're done, press **Submit** to see a personalized \"Hello!\" message. catalog/documentation.md Copy 1 { 2 \"tagline\": \"Say hi!\", 3 \"details\": \"DemoApp says Hello to a user.\", 4 \"categoryTerms\": [], 5 \"keywords\": [\"hello world\"], 6 \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/developer-website\", 7 \"whatsNew\": \"feat: Add new icons\" 8 } catalog/config.json Copy This will tell users what you added in the latest version of your Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Submit this new metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from demo-app... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app Uploading screenshots from demo-app/launchers/launcher... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/launchers/launcher Uploading screenshots from demo-app/nerdlets/home... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/nerdlets/home ✔ Updated metadata for DemoApp 1.0.1 Step 7 of 7 Go to the catalog and subscribe to your Nerdpack to see your new icon: Resolve issues with submitting catalog information Sometimes, when you work with catalog metadata, you may run into issues. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack Remember that you can only submit catalog metadata for Nerdpacks that have already been published. If you try to submit information for a Nerdpack that hasn't been published, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating DemoApp 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN Resize your images Screenshots for the catalog must meet the criteria specified previously in this guide. If they don't, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 2 errors while updating DemoApp 1.0.1 › › catalog/screenshots/screenshot.png › Invalid Screenshot: screenshot.png has a size ratio of 4:2.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"categoryTerms\": [\"browser agent\"], \"keywords\": [\"a/b test\"], \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the Instant Observability category in which to place the app, search keywords, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog metadata. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): categoryTerms.0: browser agent description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest keywords.0: a/b test icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"categoryTerms\": [\"browser agent\"], \"keywords\": [\"a/b test\"], \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the Instant Observability category in which to place the app, search keywords, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog metadata. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application.

      "body": "Here are some best practices based on how OpenTelemetry works with New Relic: Resources Batching Compression Traces Metrics Logs Resources A resource in OpenTelemetry represents information about an entity generating telemetry data. All telemetry data sent to New Relic is expected to be associated with a resource so that it can be linked with the appropriate entity in New Relic. The OpenTelemetry Resource SDK specification defines the functionality implemented by all language SDKs for defining a resource. The following suites of attributes are defined by the OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions. These attributes are usually set by creating a resource using the OpenTelemetry SDK. service.* attributes service.name attribute is required to associate your resource with an entity in the UI service.instance.id is required for certain panes to light up telemetry.sdk.language=java is required to see data in the JVM section Batching Caution Avoid getting rate limited! You should batch requests sent to the OTLP endpoint as described in this section. By default, the OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collector send one (1) data point per request. Using these defaults, it is likely your account will be rate limited. All OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collectors provide a BatchProcessor, which batches data points in memory. This batching allows requests to be sent with more than one (1) data point. Component Batch Processor Collector Batch Processor Go SDK BatchSpanProcessor JS SDK BatchSpanProcessor Python SDK BatchExportSpanProcessor Compression New Relic supports gzip compression for OTLP payloads exported over gRPC. To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. If there are other compression formats you'd like to see us support, please let us know in the CNCF Slack channel. Traces Familiarize yourself with these trace topics to ensure your traces and spans appear in New Relic. Required fields The startTimeUnixNano and endTimeUnixNano fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When startTimeUnixNano is not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. When endTimeUnixNano is not present, the duration of your span is large and negative. The timeUnixNano field on span events is required. When timeUnixNano is not present, the span event is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. The traceId and spanId fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When traceId or spanId are not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. Sampling Trace data is the most mature OpenTelemetry data type. Because of this, New Relic's OpenTelemetry user experience is largely based on trace data and is therefore influenced by your sampling strategy. You can configure sampling in a number of places: Service: Use the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language. Collector: If you're running your own instance of the OpenTelemetry collector, you can configure it to do more sophisticated forms of sampling, such as tail-based sampling (see below). Check out this documentation about how to configure different types of sampling: OpenTelemetry built-in samplers Built-in samplers implemented by the OpenTelemetry SDK for each language. OpenTelemetry tail-based samplers The OpenTelemetry collector has a tail-based sampling processor. We have an example demonstrating the use of the tail-based sampling processor. New Relic tail-based sampling with Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing is New Relic's tail-based sampling option. You can use this in conjunction with your OpenTelemetry instrumented services. In setting up Infinite Tracing, you need to override the default span endpoint and send telemetry data to the New Relic trace observer: Important Currently, Infinite Tracing does not support OTLP ingest. You must run your own instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector and configure it to use the New Relic exporter. Follow the steps in Set up the trace observer to get the value for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Use the value of YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL to configure your integration. Since you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, make sure to verify that your OpenTelemetry integrations use the AlwaysOn sampler. Metrics OpenTelemetry metrics are largely compatible with New Relic dimensional metrics. We support OpenTelemetry metrics v0.10. All of the supported metric types include an independent set of associated attributes (name-value pairs) which map directly to dimensions you can use to facet or filter metric data at query time. OpenTelemetry metrics are accompanied by a set of resource attributes that identify the originating entity that produced them and map to dimensions for faceting and filtering. The OpenTelemetry data model for metrics defines a number of different metric types: sum, gauge, histogram, and summary. Sum metrics OpenTelemetry sums are a scalar metric that is the sum of all data points over a given time window. Sums have a notion of temporality indicating whether reported values incorporate previous measurements (cumulative temporality) or not (delta temporality). In addition, sums can either be monotonic (only go up or only go down) or non-monotonic (go up and down). Delta sums In New Relic, delta metrics are handled differently depending on whether they are monotonic or non-monotonic: Monotonic delta sums are mapped to the count metric type. Non-monotonic delta sums are mapped to the gauge metric type. Cumulative sums Monotonic and non-monotonic cumulative sums are mapped to the New Relic gauge metric type. Sum configuration examples To understand how to configure aggregation temporality, see these examples using the Java and Go OpenTelemetry SDKs. Gauge metrics OpenTelemetry gauge metric data points represent a sampled value at a given time. These values are converted to the New Relic gauge metric type. OpenTelemetry gauges do not have an aggregation temporality, but the sampled values can be aggregated at query time. Histogram metrics OpenTelemetry histograms compactly represent a population of recorded values along with a total count and sum. Optionally, histograms may include a series of buckets with explicit bounds and a count value for that bucket’s population. OpenTelemetry histograms are converted to New Relic’s distribution metric type, which is backed by a scaled exponential base 2 histogram (see NrSketch for a more thorough explanation). Counts from OpenTelemetry histogram buckets are assigned to New Relic’s distribution metric buckets using linear interpolation. Also, OpenTelemetry has negative and positive infinity bound buckets which we represent in New Relic as zero-width buckets. We do this because we do not have a representation for negative and positive infinity. For example, an OpenTelemetry bucket with bounds [-∞, 10) will be represented by a [10,10) zero width New Relic bucket. You may see exaggerated bucket counts at the endpoints of your distribution due to this translation. Summary metrics OpenTelemetry summary metric data points are used to represent quantile summaries (for example, P99 latency). These map directly to the New Relic summary metric type. Summary metric data points include count, sum, and quantile values, with 0.0 as min and 1.0 as max. OpenTelemetry provides summary metrics for compatibility with other formats. Start time The startTimeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification. When this field is provided, it is used for the timestamp on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration is calculated as timeUnixNano - startTimeUnixNano. The duration field is used to calculate the queryable endTimeStamp attribute on the New Relic metric, but it serves no other semantic purpose. If startTimeUnixNano is not provided, then timeUnixNano is used for the timestamp field on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration field is set to zero. Array values for attributes OpenTelemetry metrics and other signals may include attributes that consist of a homogenous array of primitive types. These attributes are not supported by New Relic. Exemplars OpenTelemetry defines exemplar values that allow other signals, like traces, to be connected to a metric event and provide context. Exemplars are not supported by New Relic. How to query metrics Consider these tips for building metric NRQL queries in New Relic. Query cumulative sums stored as gauges Since cumulative sums are converted to gauges, here are some ways to query your data: Example: Raw gauge value for cumulative sums To view the raw gauge value for cumulative sums, you can use the latest() NRQL function: SELECT latest(totalApiBytesSent) FROM Metric TIMESERIES FACET description, statusCode Copy Example: Rate of change with cumulative sums as gauges To see the rate of change over a given time interval for a cumulative sum stored as a gauge, you can use the derivative() NRQL function: SELECT derivative(totalApiBytesSent, 1 second) FROM Metric TIMESERIES 5 MINUTES SLIDE BY 1 MINUTE FACET description, statusCode Copy New Relic does not currently support either reporting on resets and gaps or accounting for them with cumulative counters. Query gauge metrics When New Relic converts cumulative sums to gauges, you can query them using either the latest() or derivative() NRQL functions. The function you choose depends on whether you want to see the raw value or compute the rate of change. Query histogram metrics New Relic histograms translated from OpenTelemetry metrics have the same query semantics as other New Relic histograms. Namely, the histogram() NRQL function can be used to represent the histogram with a configurable number of buckets and bucket width. Note that you may see larger bucket counts at the endpoint buckets. This is because we are adding negative and positive infinity bound OpenTelemetry buckets into a zero width New Relic bucket. Example: Normal distribution FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) WHERE distributionType = 'Normal Distribution' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Example: Heat map The FACET keyword is also available to create heat map charts. FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) FACET distributionType SINCE 1 day ago Copy Important The TIMESERIES keyword is not supported for New Relic histograms. Logs Logs generated from your applications and environment are an important piece of telemetry. They may represent application logs, machine generated events, or system logs. OpenTelemetry has defined a log data model for representing log data. You can send logs using OpenTelemetry tooling, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Collector and OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repositories contain a number of components for consuming log data. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs to New Relic via the OTLP exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application. The time field The timeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification for log data. When timeUnixNano is not present New Relic will use the time that the data was received for the New Relic log timestamp.",

When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference.

To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: Tip Add your New Relic license key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, add the following option before the nr1.flow line: $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ $ nr1.flow $ ## If you want to use FedRAMP, add the following flag to use the FedRAMP authorized endpoints: $ ## -nr_region=GOV \\ Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source argument as necessary To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring.

Before you build a quickstart, you need to spin up a docker container. The container consists of two important services: A python program that mimics the database and also provides functions for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. It also makes use of newrelic_telemetry_sdk to send telemetry data to New Relic. A simulator service that generates dummy database traffic so you don't have to manually perform CRUD operations To spin up these services, you first need to set NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY environment variable. Prepare your environment On your local machine, set your license key in an environment variable: bash Copy $ export NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Your mock database uses this key to write telemetry data to New Relic. You can find your New Relic license key in your account settings. Spin up demo services Clone the lab repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/build-a-quickstart-lab.git This repository contains the code for Flashdb as well as the simulator for dummy database traffic. Navigate to the demo directory and execute the following commands to build and run docker image: bash Copy $ docker build -t flashdb . $ docker run -e NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=$NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY flashdb Here, you build and run docker image that generates mock database traffic. You will observe this data in New Relic. Once the docker image is up and running, you see the following output in your terminal: bash Copy $ docker build -t flashdb . $ docker run -e NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=$NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY flashdb Writing... try_send Writing... try_send Reading... try_send Reading... try_send Sent metrics successfully! sending event...

With New Relic dashboards, you observe and interpret the data you collect from your application. You gather the data you want to see into charts to customize the way you see it. In this procedure, you create a dashboard in New Relic. Create a dashboard Navigate to New Relic and sign in with your account. Here, you see different tabs such as Browse Data, Dashboards, Alerts & AI. Move to Dashboards and click Create a dashboard in the top right corner. Name your dashboard \"FlashDB\" and click create. Add charts to your dashboard Once the dashboard is in place, you can start creating charts. You're going to add the following charts: Database methods Average response time Errors Database size Cache hits Keys Database methods Hover over the dashboard and click Add a new chart. From this screen, you add charts using our query builder, or you choose to add text, images, or links using Markdown. Click Add a chart. It may open the query builder option. Switch to the NRQL editor and edit the query as follows: SELECT count(*) FROM fdb_method FACET method Copy Click Run to see above results. Here, you see the count of each FlashDB query, grouped by method. You can choose to present your results in different formats such as table, billboard, or pie chart. Change the chart type to pie, name your chart \"Database methods\", and click save. The chart is now visible on your dashboard. You can add more charts to your dashboard following the same pattern. To do so, click + in upper right hand corner. This takes you to the same Add to your dashboard page. Add another chart to your dashboard. Average response time Run the following query to observe the average response time of FlashDB queries.

If you haven't already, checkout the lab introduction Each procedure in this lab builds on top of the last one, so make sure you Create a dashboard before proceeding with this one. With New Relic alerts, you can monitor your services and receive notifications about problems that you're interested in, so you can react fast to troubleshoot and resolve them. Tip It is assumed that you are already familiar with the alerts basics. If you're just getting started, visit the alert documentation to familiarize yourself with the basics before proceeding. Create an alert policy Before you set alert conditions, you must create a policy. From Alert & AI, go to the Alerts section and click Policies from left-hand navigation. Then, click New alert policy. Name your policy FlashDB alert policy. Use the default values for the rest of the fields and click Create alert policy. The next step is to add conditions to the alert policy. Create alert conditions You're going to add the following alert conditions: slow read responses low cache hit ratio Create a high response time alert condition Under FlashDB alert policy, click Create a condition. The next page asks you to choose a category for your condition. Choose NRQL, which allows you to create a condition using a NRQL query. Then, click Next, define thresholds. You want New Relic to notify you if the read operation is taking longer than expected. Name your alert condition \"slow read responses\" and enter the following NRQL query for your condition. SELECT average(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Here, you selected the average read response for FlashDB. Scroll down on the same page to define threshold. Select Static as the threshold type. It is the simplest threshold type and creates a condition based on the numeric value returned by the query. Set the critical threshold value at 0.9: Here, you defined a condition that will open violation whenever read response time is above 0.9 for at least 5 minutes. Next, click Add warning threshold. Enter the threshold value at 0.8 to get a warning when the read response is above 0.8 for at least 5 minutes. Then, click Save condition. Now, You can see your new condition under your FlashDB alert policy. Create a cache hit ratio condition You claimed that your database is fastest in the space, so you also want New Relic to notify you if your cache hit ratio is too low. Add another condition under the same policy by clicking Add a condition. The next page asks you to choose the category for your condition. Choose NRQL and click Next, define threshold. Enter the name \"Low cache hit ratio\" for your condition and use the following NRQL query. SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits)/sum(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Next, add threshold values for critical violation and warning. The procedure is same as before. The only difference is that you want New Relic to notify you if the query returns a value below 0.85 and open a critical violation if the value falls below 0.75 for at least 5 minutes. Save the condition to add it to your alert policy which now looks like the following. Add a notification channel To receive notifications for any opened violations, you also need to add a notification channel. First, move to the Notification channels tab and click Add notification channels. From the list of channel options, click Email. Select the email you want to receive your notifications on, and click Update policy. Notification channel is now added. Summary During this procedure, you created FlashDB alert policy and added slow read responses and low cache hit ratio conditions to it. You also added a notification channel to receive notifications about any opened violations. Lab This procedure is a part of lab that teaches you how to build a quickstart.

      "body": "Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on the number of events that can be reported. This document explains: Why event-reporting limits are necessary How sampling works How to work with and understand sampled data Difference between events and metrics This document is about limits on event data and how those limits lead to sampling. First, it may help you to understand the differences between these two types of data: Metrics: aggregated measurements over time. Examples: average response time over a one-minute time range, throughput over time, CPU utilization over time. Events: discrete events that happen at a specific moment in time. Examples: a log or error being reported, or a configuration change. Some events are aggregated over time to form metrics (for example: a count of errors over time). These two types of data have different uses: metrics are useful for recognizing patterns over time in your system, and events are useful for drilling down and getting detail about the causes of those patterns. Because metrics are aggregated over time, they’re useful for spotting trends and changes in system behavior. For metrics that represent an aggregated count of events (like an HTTP response time metric), the individual events give you granular detail about what happened, and let you facet by attributes that have high cardinality (like account or user ID). Why sampling of events is necessary Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on how many events can be reported per harvest cycle. This is necessary because if there were no limit, a very large number of events being sent could have performance impacts on your application or on New Relic. When the limit is reached, the agents begin sampling events. Different agents have different limits, but the goal is to give a representative sample from across the harvest cycle. Also, agents may sample if they can't connect to New Relic. When an agent can’t connect to New Relic, it continues to store data locally. But it must restrict the size of the payload that is eventually sent. For this reason, it samples events during the disconnected period. The longer it is disconnected, the more it will sample. The impact of sampling One result of sampling is that there can be a discrepancy between unsampled metric data and sampled event data. Examples of this: An APM chart showing unsampled metric data may show you higher throughput than an equivalent NRQL query of sampled event data. For more about the difference between our metric timeslice data and event data, see Data types. A non-New Relic monitoring service may show different results from New Relic. Events that are capped and subject to sampling include: Transaction TransactionError Span (see Distributed tracing sampling) Custom events reported via agent API (example: the .NET agent's RecordCustomEvent) Mobile MobileRequest MobileCrash MobileHandledException Important For APM, you can compensate for sampling when querying data. Change how sampling occurs Before attempting to change how sampling occurs, please read these caveats and recommendations: Reporting more events will result in the agent using more memory. There will usually be a way for you to get the data you need without raising an agent's event-reporting limit. The payload size limit is 1MB (10^6 bytes) (compressed), so the number of events may still be affected by that limit. To determine if events are being dropped, see the agent log for a 413 HTTP status message. Here are some ways to impact sampling: Most agents have configuration options for changing the limit on sampled transactions (examples: Java agent’s max_samples_stored or the Android mobile agent’s setMaxEventPoolSize). If it’s important to you that a specific app activity not be sampled, you can use the Event API. You could deploy your application across a greater number of instances. Because the limits are per-agent, more agents will mean a larger event reservoir. APM: Compensate for sampling When querying APM-reported events, you can compensate for sampling by using EXTRAPOLATE. This will give you an approximation of what unsampled data looks like.",

Now, you want to help users of FlashDB to quickly and easily observe it in New Relic. To achieve your goal, contribute a quickstart to New Relic I/O so other users can quickly monitor FlashDB. Why quickstarts? With New Relic you can collect, monitor, and report data from different sources. You can use dashboards to view, explore, customize, understand, and correlate the data you collect using different user-friendly charts. You can also set alert policies to monitor key performance metrics and receive notifications for anomalies. Traditionally, FlashDB users would have to spend crucial development hours creating dashboards, alerts, and other entities to monitor their database. But with quickstarts, you can do that work for them. Quickstarts provide immediate value for your specific use case. They include: Clear instructions for instrumenting your services Observbility building blocks like dashboards and alerts All of this is available through an open ecosystem where New Relic developers, partners, and customers contribute their best-practice solutions.

With New Relic alerts, you can monitor your services and receive notifications about problems that you're interested in, so you can react fast to troubleshoot and resolve them. Tip It is assumed that you are already familiar with the alerts basics. If you're just getting started, visit the alert documentation to familiarize yourself with the basics before proceeding. Create an alert policy Before you set alert conditions, you must create a policy. From Alert & AI, go to the Alerts section and click Policies from left-hand navigation. Then, click New alert policy. Name your policy FlashDB alert policy. Use the default values for the rest of the fields and click Create alert policy. The next step is to add conditions to the alert policy. Create alert conditions You're going to add the following alert conditions: slow read responses low cache hit ratio Create a high response time alert condition Under FlashDB alert policy, click Create a condition. The next page asks you to choose a category for your condition. Choose NRQL, which allows you to create a condition using a NRQL query. Then, click Next, define thresholds. You want New Relic to notify you if the read operation is taking longer than expected. Name your alert condition \"slow read responses\" and enter the following NRQL query for your condition. SELECT average(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Here, you selected the average read response for FlashDB. Scroll down on the same page to define threshold. Select Static as the threshold type. It is the simplest threshold type and creates a condition based on the numeric value returned by the query. Set the critical threshold value at 0.9: Here, you defined a condition that will open violation whenever read response time is above 0.9 for at least 5 minutes. Next, click Add warning threshold. Enter the threshold value at 0.8 to get a warning when the read response is above 0.8 for at least 5 minutes. Then, click Save condition. Now, You can see your new condition under your FlashDB alert policy. Create a cache hit ratio condition You claimed that your database is fastest in the space, so you also want New Relic to notify you if your cache hit ratio is too low. Add another condition under the same policy by clicking Add a condition. The next page asks you to choose the category for your condition. Choose NRQL and click Next, define threshold. Enter the name \"Low cache hit ratio\" for your condition and use the following NRQL query. SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits)/sum(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Next, add threshold values for critical violation and warning. The procedure is same as before. The only difference is that you want New Relic to notify you if the query returns a value below 0.85 and open a critical violation if the value falls below 0.75 for at least 5 minutes. Save the condition to add it to your alert policy which now looks like the following. Add a notification channel To receive notifications for any opened violations, you also need to add a notification channel. First, move to the Notification channels tab and click Add notification channels. From the list of channel options, click Email. Select the email you want to receive your notifications on, and click Update policy. Notification channel is now added. Summary During this procedure, you created FlashDB alert policy and added slow read responses and low cache hit ratio conditions to it. You also added a notification channel to receive notifications about any opened violations. Lab This procedure is a part of lab that teaches you how to build a quickstart.

Doc Quickstart for Kafka monitoring Kafka monitoring is important to track services running on multiple Kafka servers in real-time. Observe key metrics like CPU usage, memory, and consumer lag at a glance in a Kafka dashboard. Why monitoring kafka is so important Apache Kafka is a fault-tolerant, scalable messaging system used to build real-time data pipelines. Kafka also supports replications natively, and you can build streaming applications that run inside production environments. Leveraging a Kafka monitoring tool to monitor data replication, retention, and issues like consumer lag is important. New Relic’s Kafka quickstart lets you look at performance metrics and inventory data, create your own custom charts and queries, and create alert policies. New Relic Kafka quickstart features New Relic’s Kafka monitoring tracks space and time retention, leverages replication alerts to uncover potential issues, and uses queries and a Kafka dashboard to explore them. New Relic + Kafka quickstart New Relic’s performance monitoring provides instant observability out-of-the-box.

      "body": "With a quickstart, you let your users quickly install dashboards, alerts, and other resources. Here, you learn how to use New Relic's GraphQL API, NerdGraph, to query your existing alert conditions and configure them in your quickstart. Important This guide assumes you already have alerts in your New Relic account and a quickstart that you want to add those alerts to. If you don't already have a quickstart, follow our lab to learn how to build one. Set up your quickstart's alerts directory This guide assumes you have a quickstart. However, your quickstart may or may not already have alerts. Either way, to add alerts to your quickstart, you need an alerts directory. If your quickstart already has one, you can skip this section. The _template directory of New Relic One quickstarts contains an alerts template folder. Copy this folder to your quickstart. From here, you use the YAML file that corresponds to the alert condition type you want to add to your quickstart. Once your quickstart is ready to add alerts, you need to look up your alert condition's ID. Look up your alert's condition ID To populate your alert configurations with NerdGraph, you first need to look up its identifier. Step 1 of 5 From your New Relic homepage, go to Alerts & AI. Step 2 of 5 Click Policies in left hand navigation. Step 3 of 5 Choose your policy from the list. Step 4 of 5 Here, you see the list of conditions. Choose the condition that you want to query. Step 5 of 5 On the Next page, you see ID, Account, and Policy associated with the condition. Copy the ID. With this identifier, you can now query your alert conditions and use the response to build out alert resources in your quickstart. Query alert conditions in NerdGraph There are three types of alerts you can have in New Relic: Static Baseline Outlier Jump to the appropriate section for the kind of alert you want to add to your quickstart. Query your static alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name type nrql { query } valueFunction terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlStaticCondition for your condition's ID, name, query and more. These are the required fields you need to create the same alert in your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get a JSON representation of the specified condition. Next, use this response to add a static alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane. Step 4 of 4 Populate static-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Static Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the host count is < 2. # Type of alert type: STATIC # NRQL query nrql: query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction\" # Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE) valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Operator used to compare against the threshold. operator: BELOW # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a static alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your baseline alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { id name nrql { query } baselineDirection terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition for your condition's name, query, baselineDirection, and other fields required to add the condition to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data of your alert. Next, use this response to add baseline alert to your quickstart. Tip Notice the checkboxes in the left-hand pane get checked when you paste the query in the explorer. This query returns the fields required to add alert to the quickstart. If you've set custom fields or want to query more information, feel free to either edit the query in the center pane of the explorer or check the corresponding box in the left-hand pane. Step 4 of 4 Populate baseline-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Baseline Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the average Transaction duration deviates 2 standard deviations from the normal. # Type of alert type: BASELINE # NRQL query nrql: # Baseline alerts can use an optional FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" # Direction in which baseline is set (Default: LOWER_ONLY) baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 2 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600, must be a multiple of 60 for Baseline conditions thresholdDuration: 180 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added a baseline alert to your quickstart. If it's helpful, you can rename this file to whatever you want. Query your outlier alert condition Step 1 of 4 Open the NerdGraph API explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Step 2 of 4 Copy the following GraphQL query and paste it in the center pane of the explorer. { actor { account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { id name nrql { query } expectedGroups terms { priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Here, you query AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition for required fields to add an outlier alert to your quickstart. Important Make sure you replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query. Step 3 of 4 Execute the query to get the configuration data for your alert condition. Next, use this response to add a outlier alert to your quickstart. Step 4 of 4 Populate outlier-alert.yml from your alerts quickstart folder with the data returned from your query. Given the example response from the last step, our file looks like: --- # Name of the alert name: Outlier Condition # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered when any facet(s) deviate from the center of the group for at least 5 mins # Type of alert type: OUTLIER # NRQL query nrql: # Outlier alerts require FACET query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET http.statusCode\" # Number of groups expected in the returned values for the condition (Default: 2) expectedGroups: 4 # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 1 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 2592000 Copy Here, you added an outlier alert to your quickstart.

      "body": "What is MLOps? MLOps stands for machine-learning operations. As more companies invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there's a gap in understanding between the data science teams developing machine-learning models and the DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models. MLOps provides a tool for monitoring and observing the performance and effectiveness of machine-learning models in a production environment. This increases the possibilities for collaboration between data science and DevOps teams, feeding into a continuous process of development, testing, and operational monitoring. The Datarobot integration Datarobot provides tools for deploying your machine-learning models into production. By integrating, Datarobot's integration with New Relic, you'll be able to instrument, analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your machine-learning performance across your entire system. By rigorously observing your capabilities, you'll be able to react quickly to changes in the model's input or output and the relationship between the two. Send your model performance metrics from Datarobot Insights to New Relic and you'll have real-time monitoring for your algorithms. You'll explore your metrics data with user-friendly charts and learn the state of your algorithms at a glance for faster and more efficient troubleshooting. Integrate Datarobot with New Relic First, Datarobot uses a Kafka topic to stream Insights from your machine-learning algorithm's performance metrics. Then, the New Relic connector (another algorithm) transforms the Kafka topic into a metrics data payload for a specific New Relic account. Datarobot uses Kafka and Event Flows to send data to New Relic. With Datarobot’s Event Flows, when a new message is set to your Kafka topic, your configured New Relic connector algorithm gets called. The connector transforms your metrics and sends them to your New Relic account. Connect your Datarobot data to New Relic By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Datarobot machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. Start monitoring your Datarobot event flows with New Relic.

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph. If you’re already familiar with the dashboards API, you can read Create dashboards with NerdGraph. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Find the NerdGraph API explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope. Dashboard CRUD operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes actor > entity() query Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID. dashboardCreate() mutation Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdate() mutation Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardDelete() mutation Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard. dashboardUndelete() mutation Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Dashboard page operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardUpdatePage() mutation Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage() mutation Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration. dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration. Other operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl() mutation Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. actor > dashboard > liveUrls() query List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data. dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl() mutation Revoke widget live URL operation.

      "body": "New Relic has resource limits in place to protect your experience, our systems, and our other customers. These limits range from the maximum number of characters you can have in a query, to API request rates, to how many events your queries inspect, and more. This page describes the limit metrics and NrIntegrationError events that enable you to view your limits, your current data usage and overall resource consumption as compared to those limits, and the impact of experiencing a limit event. We also provide a handful of queries that, when compiled into a dashboard, can give you consistent insight into your limits status. Important While NrIntegrationError events provide data on many limits types, resource limit metrics currently only cover request rate ingestion and API query rate limits. What happens when you reach a limit Our response to reaching a limit depends on a handful of factors: the type of limit that’s reached, as well as the duration, frequency, and amount at which you exceed the limit. Exceeding a limit doesn’t always mean you experience a limit event, such as dropped data, rejected traffic, or having your data turned off for the rest of the day. We sometimes allow a small buffer before enforcing a limit. That said, any resource consumed above 100% is at risk for limit impact at any time. Many of our rate limits apply proportionally. That means if you’re barely exceeding the limit, we will take less action than if you're exceeding by 200%. Limit metrics are only visible if you're sending data in to a corresponding dataType or limitName API. For example, if you send in data via the Metric API, you’ll see the Metric API resource metrics, but if you don't send any APM data in, you won't see APM resource metrics. Tip Impact metrics will be generated regardless of impact; if there's no impact, you’ll see a 0. An NrIntegrationError event is generated when you experience impact and is a good way to quickly see if you’re experiencing any limit events. See View System Limits for more information. Create a dashboard to view your limit status Using three limit metrics together on a dashboard, you can quickly see detailed visuals of your Ingest Resource Request Per Minute limits, and with NrIntegrationError get a view into more limits. Dashboard displaying limits status using a handful of queries. We used the following queries to create this dashboard. To make a dashboard like this in New Relic One, select Dashboards, and then Create a dashboard. Then, add a new chart for each query you want to regularly monitor. The three limits metrics included in these queries are described in a separate section, below. From left to right, top to bottom: Resource Consumption Limits as a % FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) /latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Max % Consumption in an hour SELECT max(`usage`) FROM (FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 as 'usage' facet limitName timeseries ) facet limitName limit max Copy APM Agent API transaction events request per minute FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) where limitName = 'APM Agent API transaction events requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Trace API With limit line FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'usage', latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as 'limit' where limitName = 'Trace API requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Impact FACET From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource TIMESERIES 1 minute limit max Copy NrIntegrationError by limit FROM NrIntegrationError select count(*) facet limitName TIMESERIES MAX since 1 day ago limit max Copy Multi-Account limits (on time series charts only) If you want to see limits for multiple accounts on one chart: run this query from one of the accounts: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Click Add another query. Select a different account. Then run this query again: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Finally, save it. Limit list and NrIntegrationError FROM Metric, NrIntegrationError select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'Per Minute Count',latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as ' limit Value',(rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue)*100)as 'Percent Used', filter (count(*), where NrIntegrationError.limitValue is not null) as 'limit reached count' facet limitName limit 1000 Copy Limit metrics These metrics, used in the dashboard queries above, can hone in on a single limit or resource. Or, with the help of FACET limitName or resource provide a view across all your limits. newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue limitValue allows you to see the setting for a limit by limitName and understand more about what resource is linked to this limit. The following examples use the limit value metric in the query: Example for Metric API requests per minute. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) WHERE limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue currentValue shows you how much of a given resource you’re currently consuming. To get a better glimpse into how our systems are viewing your consumption, use a rate() function with the time period that aligns with the limitTimeInterval. Limit 200. Example for Metric API request per minute: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact impact lets you know for any given resource what impact limit events are having. Zeros mean you are not currently impacted. The most granular we have is dataType. It is possible for multiple instances of limitName to impact a single type, such as Metric RPM and DPM. If we know, we will display limitName. From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, resource, impact, limitName TIMESERIES limit max Copy Metric attributes Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue and newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue: limitName - The Name of the limit for the metric data, i.e RPM Metric API. dataType - What kind of data the metric is tracking, i.e Metric, Log, or APM. Resource - What resource is being consumed, i.e. Requests, or DPM. limitTimeInterval - What time window this resource is evaluated for limiting. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact dataType - The kind of data that is being impacted, i.e Metric, Log, APM. Resource - What resource is being impacted, i.e Request Rate. Impact - A count of what is happening when resource has exceeded set limit, i.e dropped requests. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Set alerts on resource metrics While building a dashboard to see all your limits is handy, being able to automate it is even better. You can set alerts on your limit metrics to provide updates on limits changes. Tip Because we currently only have metrics on 1 minute time windows, setting TimeWindow = 1 minute, will cover them all. Eventually, we make more metrics available, you might want to set separate alerts for limits that are enforced by different time windows. You can use the following NRQL queries to create alerts. Learn about creating alerts with NRQL queries here. Limits faceted by LimitName and scoped by Timewindow From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 facet limitName Copy Alert on a single limit From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 where limitName = 'my limit' Copy Alert on limit impact faceted by dataType, impact, resource, and reason From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason Copy Alert on impact of a single dataType From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason WHERE dataType = 'important things' Copy",

      "body": "Extensive log data can help you troubleshoot issues. But what if an attribute in your log contains thousands of characters? How much of this data can New Relic store? And how can you find useful information in all this data? How blobs work For lengthy string values that are longer than can be stored in NRDB (4,094 characters), we store the long string in three pieces: Long log sections Description First 4,094 characters The first 4,094 characters are stored in a Log event field with the same name. So a long message value would have its first 4,094 characters stored in a message field. Next 128,000 UTF-8 bytes The next 128,000 UTF-8 bytes of the string are stored in a blob field with the name with newrelic.ext. prepended. So a long message value would have characters past the first 4,094 characters stored in a newrelic.ext.message field as a blob. The actual number of characters stored depends on the UTF-8 representation of the characters. UTF-8 represents Unicode characters as one to four bytes, so we will store anywhere between 32,000 and 128,000 characters past the first 4,094 characters. Remaining characters Any characters past 4,094 characters plus 128,000 bytes are dropped and not stored. So the long message field would be stored as: message: <first 4,094 characters as a string> newrelic.ext.message: <next 128,000 bytes as a 'blob'> Copy Tip You can search the first 4,094 characters of a string attribute. You can also create alerts for the first 4,094 characters. However, since 'blob' storage is not searchable, text beyond the first 4,094 characters is not searchable or alertable. Query your data for blobs To query for any log data in New Relic, run the following query: SELECT * FROM Log Copy To expand the blob data, run the following query, using message or any other attribute. Be sure to enclose the blob's attribute with backticks. For example: SELECT message, another-attribute, blob(`newrelic.ext.message`), blob(`newrelic.ext.another-attribute) FROM Log Copy To query extended blob data in your logs, be sure to include backticks in your attribute's blob syntax. This expands the data in the blob so you can see (but not search) it. For example, New Relic returns: { \"message\": <first 4,094 characters> \"newrelic.ext.message\": <the next 128,000 bytes as Base64> \"another-attribute\": <first 4,094 characters> \"newrelic.ext.another-attribute\": <the next 128,000 bytes as Base64> } Copy The Logs UI automatically stitches the original value back together when looking at the Log Detail View. When querying using NRQL directly, you need to manually stitch the information together by: Decoding the Base64 of the newrelic.ext. attribute value Converting the resulting UTF-8 into a string Appending that string to the first 4,094 characters in the \"main\" attribute Data retention for long logs NRDB retains your blob records for a month. If you have existing long log messages stored as LogExtendedRecord, that data will also continue to be available for a month in NRDB. After a month passes, no more new LogExtendedRecord attributes will be created. They will all be stored in NRDB as blobs.",

Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage.

Setting up Prometheus is straightforward, but scaling up and managing is not. That’s where New Relic steps in. New Relic's Prometheus quickstart New Relic offers two Prometheus integration schemes, Remote Write and OpenMetrics. Remote Write is ideal for well-established Prometheus infrastructures. It provides easy access to your metrics and only takes one line of yaml in your configuration for access. OpenMetrics allows for more visibility across multiple container platforms. Once the integration is set up, you can query data on memory usage for pods in deployment, facet any metrics, and view raw metric values all in one place. New Relic's Prometheus Integration stores various kinds of telemetry data - whether open-source, vendor-specific, or vendor-agnostic. Value of the Prometheus quickstart New Relic’s quickstart makes DevOps easier. Although there are many ways to use Prometheus data in New Relic, we’ll break these down into OpenMetrics and Remote Write to help you decide on the best option for you: Use pre-built dashboards to monitor Kubernetes HPA capacity, or build your own! Monitor node readiness, and create alerts to let you know if a node is having issues and should not accept workloads Automatically instrument and monitor any OpenMetrics endpoint.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

Before you learn how you can use Pixie to monitor your Kubernetes clusters, you need to set one up. We've designed a cluster for you to use in this lab. Step 1 of 3 Clone pixie-lab-materials from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/pixie-lab-materials This repository contains all the code you need to complete this lab. Step 2 of 3 Change to the main directory, and run the setup script: bash Copy $ cd pixie-lab-materials/main $ ./setup.sh This script spins up a new minikube cluster using the Pixie-supported hyperkit driver. It also configures your network memory and CPU with limits that work well with this lab. Finally, it creates all the pods and services that make up the TinyHat application. Tip If you're using linux, update setup.sh to use the kvm2 driver instead: bash Copy $ minikube start --driver=kvm2 --cni=flannel --cpus=4 --memory=8000 -p minikube-pixie-lab If you're missing any dependencies, see the requirements in the lab overview for installation links. Step 3 of 3 In a new terminal window, open a minikube tunnel: bash Copy $ minikube tunnel -p minikube-pixie-lab This exposes the load balancer services in your cluster so you can access them. Important You may have to provide your user's password to allow minikube to work. You should now have two terminal windows: One that contains your tunnel. This needs to remain open as long as you use your website. One for running the rest of the commands in this lab In the next procedure, you familiarize yourself with your cluster and website. lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Explore your cluster, before starting this one. As the developer of TinyHat.me, you need to have visibility into your cluster. You need to know how healthy your application is. You need to know when things go wrong. But you've put it off for so long because instrumenting Kubernetes is hard and time-consuming. This is one of the things that makes Pixie so valuable. Pixie is a CNCF open source Kubernetes monitoring solution that provides: Automatic and instant baseline observability of your cluster Actionable, code-level insights of your applications With Pixie's auto-telemetry, you'll instrument your cluster in minutes to get dynamic data such as protocol traces, resource metrics, and app metrics from your cluster—all without an agent! Tip If you haven't signed into New Relic, do that now so you're ready to install Pixie into your cluster. Step 1 of 10 Open New Relic. On the right side of the upper navigation bar, click Add more data: Step 2 of 10 Click Guided install: This walks you through the installation process. Step 3 of 10 Click Kubernetes to let New Relic guide you through instrumenting your Kubernetes cluster: Step 4 of 10 Click Begin installation: Step 5 of 10 Select your account, name your cluster \"tiny-hat\", and click Continue: This specifies that TinyHat.me, and all its services, should live in a New Relic cluster called \"tiny-hat\" in the account you selected. Step 6 of 10 Leave the default choices on the next screen. These provide a range of observability features for your cluster, including our infrastructure agent which gives you a high level overview of the health of your cluster. Notably, the default options include \"Instant service-level insights, full-body requests, and application profiles through Pixie\" which you focus on in this lab. Click Continue: In the next screen, you see a command for installing our Kubernetes integration into your cluster. Step 7 of 10 Click Copy command: Now you're ready to install Pixie into your cluster. Step 8 of 10 Switch back to your terminal and paste the Helm command. Step 9 of 10 While you're installing Pixie, switch back to New Relic and click Continue to progress your guided installation to the final step. Here, you see a message that says \"Listening for data\": In a few minutes, Helm will have fully installed the necessary charts. You should see a message with the name, deployed date, namespace, and more: bash Copy NAME: newrelic-bundle LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Sep 23 13:50:24 2021 NAMESPACE: newrelic STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None Soon after that, the New Relic page updates to tell you that we're receiving data from your cluster: Step 10 of 10 Click Kubernetes cluster explorer to see your nodes, pods, deployments and a host of other data about your cluster, all in one view: Important You may see an error message, \"We're receiving incomplete data for this cluster.\" Please wait a few more minutes and refresh the page to see your cluster. In minutes, you were able to instrument your entire cluster without having to install language-specific agents or specify detailed cluster information! On top of all the data you see in the cluster explorer, click a pod or a node to dig deeper and see the granular data that the infrastructure agent was able to access near-instantly: lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie.

Pixie auto-telemetry is powered by eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct that enables Pixie to seamlessly collect fine-grained telemetry data — service-level metrics, unsampled requests, and more. With one install command, you get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Quickly start observing and debugging Kubernetes clusters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Important Auto-Telemetry with Pixie leverages Community Cloud with Pixie, a separate platform from New Relic One. Use of Community Cloud with Pixie is subject to separate terms of service. Explore your cluster Access the Pixie UI via New Relic's Live debugging with Pixie area of your Kubernetes clusters. The cluster explorer provides a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Note that you cannot log directly into the Pixie UI unless you have created a separate Pixie login. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages like Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. And at a glance, Flamegraph tells you what functions your application is spending time on and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta).

      "body": "Widespread adoption of containers has changed the way applications are written and deployed. Container orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes are making it easier for teams to schedule, deploy, and manage their containerized applications. But challenges still exist that require teams to rethink their environment and application monitoring strategies: Challenge 1: Containers are ephemeral by nature. Knowing the containers or pod or node (host) where the application is currently running is not necessarily an indication of where it was running 5, 15, or 30 minutes ago when the issue occurred. Containers are deployed in dynamic, constantly evolving environments that require a modern monitoring approach. Challenge 2: Often, organizations are adopting containers as they break down monolithic applications into multiple microservices. This new approach introduces new complexity to the system and the sheer scale and dimensionality of containers is hard to conceptualize in an easy-to-understand format. Challenge 3: Delivering a differentiated end-user experience is a key initiative for all organizations, and containers are being adopted to help organizations release better software, faster. But with this tremendous opportunity also comes risk, because every time a new container is deployed, the cluster is impacted. Organizations need context into how infrastructure changes impact the application stack, and how changes to both the infrastructure and application stack affect the end-user experience. Getting all of this data in real-time in a digestible format is a significant challenge in distributed, containerized environments. The New Relic platform offers customers both ease of use and ease of deployment for containerized Kubernetes environments. With a few clicks you have the data and confidence to move forward intelligently. These six steps illustrate how to use the New Relic One platform to manage your containers and how they are scheduled: 1. Update to latest infrastructure agent and enable Kubernetes integration To get started, you'll need to deploy the latest Infrastructure agent onto a Kubernetes cluster with a DaemonSet. Leveraging DaemonSets is vital in dynamic, containerized environments, because when a new node is deployed or the cluster scales up or down, the DaemonSet ensures the New Relic agent is running on these new nodes. In addition, to build a complete picture of your Kubernetes environment, New Relic aggregates data from many resources, including Kube-state metrics. New Relic's “Kubernetes aware” approach makes it easy for Kubernetes to do its job as an orchestrator without missing a single node, cluster, or event. 2. Leverage the Kubernetes cluster explorer to further explore cluster performance and health Once the Kubernetes integration is installed, you can access the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer, which offers a differentiated, intuitive way to visualize the health and performance of Kubernetes clusters. It applies advanced capabilities to filter, sort, and search for Kubernetes entities, helping teams understand the relationships and dependencies within an environment. It's a powerful and innovative solution to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at massive scale. 3. Navigate out-of-the-box dashboards to analyze historical metrics of your Kubernetes environment Above and beyond what the cluster explorer provides, New Relic provides out-of-the-box dashboards that allow customers to analyze performance and operating metrics of their Kubernetes environments. Key metrics include the number of containers, resource consumption, pending pods, out of memory (OOM) kills, and stuck pods. These metrics may be particularly relevant to Kubernetes administrators who require reliable, up-to-date information on resource consumption against pre-set thresholds. Access these dashboards directly from the cluster explorer where you can first visually explore your cluster and then use filters to drive down into specific dashboards that match that filter. 4. Monitor applications running in Kubernetes with APM One advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure agent being application-aware is that the cluster explorer is automatically aware of New Relic agents that are deployed on new applications. To fully exploit these capabilities, we recommend monitoring all existing and future containerized applications running in Kubernetes by installing the APM agent on them. Starting again from the cluster explorer, you can dig into what's happening in your applications from the context of the Kubernetes cluster. This gives you the ability to intuitively correlate your infrastructure and applications and begin analytically troubleshooting across the stack. Cloud-native applications use many interconnected services. The cluster explorer will correlate the application and link to its distributed tracings. In complex systems the ability to trace and identify pathways and latency bottlenecks are not optional. Correlate your Kubernetes back-end with end-user experience using browser and synthetic monitoring If you are orchestrating an end-user facing application, New Relic allows you to view the end-to-end impact your infrastructure and services have on your customer experience. We tackle end-user management in two ways: With synthetic monitoring, you can track application availability and performance from a wide variety of global locations visualizing if customer experience is impacted due to geography. With browser and mobile, we recommend monitoring such KPIs as load time and availability. Marrying end-user data with metrics and dashboards provided by the cluster explorer enables operators, administrators, app developers, and business personnel to align on common initiatives. 6. Bring teams together with dashboards tailored to specific business use cases and KPIs With dashboards, you can build custom visualizations from an end-to-end service perspective to analyze the cluster, pods, application, and end-user experience in one clean visual display. By using New Relic's dashboards, cross-organizational teams can align to share a common language and single source of truth, helping them make better decisions and drive business impact. The top two rows of this sample dashboard visualize various aspects of a Kubernetes environment while the third row illustrates valuable information regarding the applications that are deployed to this cluster. The bottom row displays the end-user viewpoint.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Debug missing images in your service, before starting this one. After fixing your last TinyHat.me bug, you and your team are feeling confident. It's time to push your next release to production. Change to the scenario-2 directory and set up your environment: bash Copy $ cd ../scenario-2 $ ./setup.sh Please wait while we update your lab environment. deployment.apps/admin-service configured deployment.apps/fetch-service configured deployment.apps/frontend-service configured deployment.apps/simulator configured Done! Now that you've released your new code, it's time to check Twitter for some user feedback: Oh no! The admin page seems to be slow. Reproduce the issue You've been notified by your users that the TinyHat admin page is running slowly. Reproduce the issue for yourself. Step 1 of 2 Look up your frontend's external IP address: bash Copy $ kubectl get services NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE add-service ClusterIP 10.109.114.34 <none> 80/TCP 20m admin-service ClusterIP 10.110.29.145 <none> 80/TCP 20m fetch-service ClusterIP 10.104.224.242 <none> 80/TCP 20m frontend-service LoadBalancer 10.102.82.89 10.102.82.89 80:32161/TCP 20m gateway-service LoadBalancer 10.101.237.225 10.101.237.225 80:32469/TCP 20m kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 20m manipulation-service ClusterIP 10.107.23.237 <none> 80/TCP 20m moderate-service ClusterIP 10.105.207.153 <none> 80/TCP 20m mysql ClusterIP 10.97.194.23 <none> 3306/TCP 20m upload-service ClusterIP 10.108.113.235 <none> 80/TCP 20m Step 2 of 2 Go to the admin page of your site: <EXTERNAL-IP>/admin?password=ilovecats Copy The page should load in between 5 and 10 seconds: Once again, your users were right. Why is your admin site taking so long to load? Use Pixie to find out! Hunt for the slowness with Pixie Five seconds is too long for your admin page to load. You can use Pixie to discover the source of the delay. Step 1 of 12 From the New Relic homepage, go to Kubernetes: Step 2 of 12 Choose your tiny-hat cluster: Step 3 of 12 Then click Live Debugging with Pixie: Step 4 of 12 Once again, the default script is px/cluster: Step 5 of 12 Scroll down, and filter to the default namespace: This shows the same information as the cluster script, but only for the default namespace. Step 6 of 12 Observe the service map for this namespace: Here, you see the first exernal request comes to the frontend service. The frontend service makes an internal call to the gateway service, which then calls the admin service. Use your knowledge of this traffic flow to debug your high latency issue. Step 7 of 12 Scroll down to the Service List and notice some of the high latency in your services: Step 8 of 12 Because you know the first service to receive requests is the frontend service, click on its name in the table: Here, you see spikes in latency over time: But this only shows you the symptom of an underlying problem. To figure out why your frontend service is slow, you need to dig a little deeper. Step 9 of 12 Scroll down to see the Sample Of Slow Inbound Requests table: Here, you see that the frontend's requests to /api/admin are slow. That's a promising lead! Now that you know that the admin service is causing your app latency, it's time to investigate that service. One good place to look when you want to know what's causing slowness in your application is a performance flamegraph for that service. Pixie's performance flamegraph shows the frequency that every function appears in stack traces across your CPUs. Pixie collects this data with a feature called continuous application profiling where it samples stack traces, aggregates those samples, and then groups the aggregates in the flamegraph. Step 10 of 12 Change to the px/perf_flamegraph script to see it in action: This graph is complex and, by default, shows more information than you need. Step 11 of 12 Filter down to the default namespace: That's better! The graph is now filtered to primarily show two specific services: manipulation-service admin-service Focus on the admin service because that's what receives requests from the frontend. Step 12 of 12 Notice two function cells from your admin service's main module: Remember, the width of the cell represents the frequency that the cell's function appears in Pixie's samples. Effectively, this represents how long the application spends in that function. In this graph, you can see that main.createSampleImage is wider than main.setupSQLQuery, implying that the admin service spends more time creating sample images than it does setting up its SQL query. You can also infer from the name of the function and the width of the manipulation-service in the graph that main.createSampleImage makes a call to that service. Based on your findings, you hypothesize that every time the frontend service calls /api/admin, the main.createSampleImage function gets executed, which sends a request to the manipulation service. In a real world situation, you could confirm this hypothesis by looking at your code. You could then solve the problem by caching sample images so that they're not created on every request. Summary To recap, you observed latency in your application's administrative backend and used Pixie in New Relic to: Understand your services' relationships Narrow down the sources of high latency Discover the function that's causing long response times Throughout this lab, you saw just a few ways that Pixie can help you monitor your software and debug issues when they come up. Tear down Now that you're done with this lab, tear down your cluster: bash Copy $ minikube delete -p minikube-pixie-lab Homework Well done!

Add an image We want to ensure that sensitive data does not appear in UI screenshots. That's why we recommend that you provide a permalink to a test account. Do not take a screenshot from your New Relic account. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images folder for your doc. For example, if your doc lives in the docs/style-guide/processes-procedures directory, use the docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/images folder. If the images directory does not exist in the directory where your doc lives, use VScode or Finder to create a folder in that directory named images (must be lower case and plural). Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name; for example, fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Continue with the following procedure to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc.

Add an inline image To use an inline image, add something like this: The UI includes a multiple app names indicator. ![Multiple app names indicator in New Relic One](./images/new-relic-distributed-tracing-multiapp-icon.png \"Multiple apps name indicator in New Relic One\") Copy If the inline image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word icon in the text. For example: Select your app's settings ![settings icon](./images/icon-settings.png \"settings icon\") icon. Copy Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-), which replace our previous Font Awesome icons New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) To see if we already have an icon you need, go to: Feather.js for docs-website in GitHub: These are the Feather icons available in the docs-website project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Gatsby theme for docs-website in GitHub: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. You can use any icons you need in the Gatsby theme or Feather. Currently these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic: <Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme for docs-website in GitHub or in the Feather.js for docs-website in GitHub, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. You can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Here's an example of adding a database icon: Go to feathericons.com. Download the database feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Copy the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG is <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then copy only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database, and assign the code from the previous step to it. If the icon has multiple paths, include the <> wrapper around it like you see with other icons. Save the feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets added automatically. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the icon component; for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

      "body": "If the dSYM is not uploaded to New Relic, mobile crash reports cannot be symbolicated. You can upload dSYMs manually or directly through the New Relic UI. However, every build of an application will create a new dSYM, and it can be difficult managing which dSYM is attributed to which app build. In this situation, you can use the Build UUID identifier to: Identify a unique build of an application. Find which dSYM can be used to symbolicate a crash. View the Build UUID An application may have more than one Build UUID, one attributed for each CPU architecture the application is built. The Build UUID is also stored within the associated dSYM and can be extracted to identify the dSYM. New Relic crash reports also contain the Build UUID of the crashing application. To view the Build UUID: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile in the top nav. Then find your app and click Crashes > Crash Analysis. From the Crash list table, select any row. From the selected crash report's Crash Details page, look for the App Image Uuid on the attribute list. If the App Image Uuid is not on the selected crash report's attributes list: Export the crash details. Look for the Build UUID in the Binary images section of the exported crash report. Use the Build UUID extracted from the crash details to find the missing dSYM. Binary images example Here is an example of the Binary images section from an exported crash report. This section lists the Build UUID for every dynamically-linked library included in the application, as well as the Build UUID for the main application. In this example, the main application is New Relic. Its Build UUID is 117667e7b8d230cb8a908906c64e0227. This is the identifier you can use to find the associated dSYM.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent stores two types of log files in the Logs directory at %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs. Both are needed for troubleshooting; for example, if no data appears in the New Relic UI for your app. If either log type is missing, some component of the .NET agent did not start. Agent logs: These file names begin with newrelic_agent_. Profiler logs: These file names begin with NewRelic.Profiler. Generate log files Important When troubleshooting your New Relic .NET agent, ensure it has been configured to generate debug level log files, and monitor the size of your log file closely. Logging at debug generates a lot of data very quickly. After reproducing your problem, return the log level to info. If your C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent is in a hidden folder, update your Windows settings so that you can see it. To generate New Relic for .NET log files: Open newrelic.config, usually located in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent (or %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent). Change the <log level=\"info\" /> setting to <log level=\"debug\" />. Save and close the file, then wait a few minutes for the agent to read the new settings. Generate a few minutes of traffic to your app. If sending your log file to New Relic Support: In your New Relic support ticket, attach the newrelic.config file (not the text of the file), and attach the entire Logs folder from C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs or from %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs. In newrelic.config, change <log level=\"debug\" /> to <log level=\"info\" />. Generate Azure Web App log files Kudu Console manages Microsoft Azure Web App log reporting. To use the Kudu Console, first log into Azure. Navigate to the URL of your Azure Web app; for example: https://example.azurewebsites.net Copy Insert the Kudu Console URL scmsnippet into the URL; for example: https://example.scm.azurewebsites.net Copy Check for the Kudu logo with a black navigation bar at the top left of the page and your Azure username at the top right of the page. Then, to change the log level within the Kudu Console: From the Kudu Console navigation bar, select the Debug console menu, then select either CMD or PowerShell. Navigate to D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic. To edit newrelic.config, select the pencil icon. Change <log level=\"info\"> to <log level=\"debug\"> Save the change to newrelic.config. Wait a few minutes for the debug logs to be generated. Use the same steps to switch the log level back to info. Collect system information In addition to agent logs, a Microsoft System Information file is also useful for troubleshooting: From the Windows task bar, select Start > Run and enter msinfo32. Select OK. After the system information page loads, select File > Save. Wait a few minutes for the server to save the file. Attach the file to your New Relic support ticket. Check permissions Sometimes the .NET agent will start but not be able to write to its logs because it does not have the necessary permissions to create the log directory and log files. Permissions management varies by environment, so you will need to work with your system administrator to verify that this is not an issue.",

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Set up your TinyHat environment, before starting this one. Your website, TinyHat.me, runs in Kubernetes. While Pixie helps you monitor your cluster and find the source of problems that arise within it, it's helpful to know about your cluster's structure and the components that make it up before learning how to use Pixie. Step 1 of 4 View your pods: bash Copy $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE add-service-5487c78c86-rsx2n 1/1 Running 0 10m admin-service-7cdcb754c9-blwpf 1/1 Running 0 10m fetch-service-68d9876b8b-2tb45 1/1 Running 5 10m frontend-service-649f75984b-xdgtg 1/1 Running 0 10m gateway-service-6bcb8bc8d5-hwxcl 1/1 Running 0 10m manipulation-service-75c4454b5d-687tf 1/1 Running 0 10m moderate-service-55985878d-td2tl 1/1 Running 0 10m mysql-576f9d87d9-45cc4 1/1 Running 0 10m simulator-554c8577-5nn52 1/1 Running 0 10m upload-service-7f68c55ddc-d5kd5 1/1 Running 0 10m Important Every pod should be running by now, but if one isn't, give it few more minutes. Here, you see nine containerized services and one simulator, each with their own pod. Instead of going into detail about the services now, you'll learn about them in context as you walk through this lab's scenarios. The simulator generates load to your website so you don't have to. Step 2 of 4 View your services next: bash Copy $ kubectl get services NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE add-service ClusterIP 10.108.136.0 <none> 80/TCP 13m admin-service ClusterIP 10.108.79.227 <none> 80/TCP 13m fetch-service ClusterIP 10.97.60.129 <none> 80/TCP 13m frontend-service LoadBalancer 10.106.184.90 10.106.184.90 80:32327/TCP 13m gateway-service LoadBalancer 10.108.122.133 10.108.122.133 80:30691/TCP 13m kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 15m manipulation-service ClusterIP 10.102.93.91 <none> 80/TCP 13m moderate-service ClusterIP 10.107.191.29 <none> 80/TCP 13m mysql ClusterIP 10.96.37.225 <none> 3306/TCP 13m upload-service ClusterIP 10.96.216.177 <none> 80/TCP 13m Here, you see your Kubernetes services. Notice that most of your app services have a corresponding Kubernetes service. One of these services is particularly important: frontend-service. This is a LoadBalancer that you connect to when you view your site. Step 3 of 4 Speaking of viewing your site, do that now by opening the EXTERNAL-IP that you see for frontend-service in your browser: Important If the frontend service's External-IP is pending, you probably forgot to minikube tunnel -p minikube-pixie-lab in another window. Step 4 of 4 Select a number of hats to display and a hat type. Then, select Hat Me: Now Bob Ross is wearing the hat(s) that you selected. Cool, right? With a better understanding of your cluster's resources and your website, you're better prepared to install Pixie and use it to monitor and debug your application when problems arise. lab This procedure is part of a course that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Debug missing images in your service, before starting this one. After fixing your last TinyHat.me bug, you and your team are feeling confident. It's time to push your next release to production. Change to the scenario-2 directory and set up your environment: bash Copy $ cd ../scenario-2 $ ./setup.sh Please wait while we update your lab environment. deployment.apps/admin-service configured deployment.apps/fetch-service configured deployment.apps/frontend-service configured deployment.apps/simulator configured Done!

Why is your admin site taking so long to load? Use Pixie to find out! Hunt for the slowness with Pixie Five seconds is too long for your admin page to load. You can use Pixie to discover the source of the delay. Step 1 of 12 From the New Relic homepage, go to Kubernetes: Step 2 of 12 Choose your tiny-hat cluster: Step 3 of 12 Then click Live Debugging with Pixie: Step 4 of 12 Once again, the default script is px/cluster: Step 5 of 12 Scroll down, and filter to the default namespace: This shows the same information as the cluster script, but only for the default namespace. Step 6 of 12 Observe the service map for this namespace: Here, you see the first exernal request comes to the frontend service. The frontend service makes an internal call to the gateway service, which then calls the admin service. Use your knowledge of this traffic flow to debug your high latency issue. Step 7 of 12 Scroll down to the Service List and notice some of the high latency in your services: Step 8 of 12 Because you know the first service to receive requests is the frontend service, click on its name in the table: Here, you see spikes in latency over time: But this only shows you the symptom of an underlying problem. To figure out why your frontend service is slow, you need to dig a little deeper. Step 9 of 12 Scroll down to see the Sample Of Slow Inbound Requests table: Here, you see that the frontend's requests to /api/admin are slow. That's a promising lead! Now that you know that the admin service is causing your app latency, it's time to investigate that service. One good place to look when you want to know what's causing slowness in your application is a performance flamegraph for that service. Pixie's performance flamegraph shows the frequency that every function appears in stack traces across your CPUs. Pixie collects this data with a feature called continuous application profiling where it samples stack traces, aggregates those samples, and then groups the aggregates in the flamegraph. Step 10 of 12 Change to the px/perf_flamegraph script to see it in action: This graph is complex and, by default, shows more information than you need. Step 11 of 12 Filter down to the default namespace: That's better! The graph is now filtered to primarily show two specific services: manipulation-service admin-service Focus on the admin service because that's what receives requests from the frontend. Step 12 of 12 Notice two function cells from your admin service's main module: Remember, the width of the cell represents the frequency that the cell's function appears in Pixie's samples. Effectively, this represents how long the application spends in that function. In this graph, you can see that main.createSampleImage is wider than main.setupSQLQuery, implying that the admin service spends more time creating sample images than it does setting up its SQL query. You can also infer from the name of the function and the width of the manipulation-service in the graph that main.createSampleImage makes a call to that service. Based on your findings, you hypothesize that every time the frontend service calls /api/admin, the main.createSampleImage function gets executed, which sends a request to the manipulation service. In a real world situation, you could confirm this hypothesis by looking at your code. You could then solve the problem by caching sample images so that they're not created on every request. Summary To recap, you observed latency in your application's administrative backend and used Pixie in New Relic to: Understand your services' relationships Narrow down the sources of high latency Discover the function that's causing long response times Throughout this lab, you saw just a few ways that Pixie can help you monitor your software and debug issues when they come up. Tear down Now that you're done with this lab, tear down your cluster: bash Copy $ minikube delete -p minikube-pixie-lab Homework Well done!

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Instrument your cluster, before starting this one. Until now, you've been working with application services that don't have bugs (we hope). You've been able to access TinyHat.me and render Bob Ross with one or more silly hats without a hitch. But it's time to deploy some new code to your cluster. Change to the scenario-1 directory and set up your environment: bash Copy $ cd ../scenario-1 $ ./setup.sh Please wait while we update your lab environment. deployment.apps/fetch-service configured deployment.apps/simulator configured Done! Uh oh! You look on social media and see some confused customers: What's wrong with TinyHat.me? Use Pixie to find out. Reproduce the issue You've been notified by your users that they can't see a particular hat on TinyHat.me. Before you start debugging your code, reproduce the issue for yourself. Step 1 of 5 Look up your frontend's external IP address: bash Copy $ kubectl get services NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE add-service ClusterIP 10.109.114.34 <none> 80/TCP 20m admin-service ClusterIP 10.110.29.145 <none> 80/TCP 20m fetch-service ClusterIP 10.104.224.242 <none> 80/TCP 20m frontend-service LoadBalancer 10.102.82.89 10.102.82.89 80:32161/TCP 20m gateway-service LoadBalancer 10.101.237.225 10.101.237.225 80:32469/TCP 20m kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 20m manipulation-service ClusterIP 10.107.23.237 <none> 80/TCP 20m moderate-service ClusterIP 10.105.207.153 <none> 80/TCP 20m mysql ClusterIP 10.97.194.23 <none> 3306/TCP 20m upload-service ClusterIP 10.108.113.235 <none> 80/TCP 20m Step 2 of 5 Paste the IP in your browser: This looks the same as it did before, except that there's a new hat style, called PIXIE. Step 3 of 5 Select a number of hats, the PIXIE style, and Hat me: Oops! Where did Bob go? Instead of rendering Bob Ross with your hat selection, the frontend served no image at all. Tip The number of hats you choose to display has no effect on the result. Step 4 of 5 Observe a network request in your browser's developer tools: Here, the response from the image request says, \"This hat style does not exist! If you want this style - try submitting it.\" You know that the PIXIE hat style most certainly does exist because you chose it from the selector. But for some reason, the application can't render the image. Step 5 of 5 For good measure, try to render a different hat style: It worked! Your users were right. There's something wrong with your application. Solve the mystery with Pixie The bad news is that you've confirmed there's an error in your application. The good news is that you recently instrumented your cluster with Pixie! Go to New Relic and sign into your account, if you haven't already. Step 1 of 14 From the New Relic homepage, go to Kubernetes: Step 2 of 14 Choose your tiny-hat cluster: Step 3 of 14 Then click Live Debugging with Pixie: This is Pixie's live, code-level debugger: You use it to drill down and learn more about the services in your cluster. Important When you go to the live debugger, you may see an error saying your cluster is disconnected. This is normal, as it takes a little while for New Relic to start seeing your Pixie data. Wait a few more minutes and refresh the debugger. Step 4 of 14 Notice the script dropdown menu at the top of the debugger: Pixie's live debugger renders data based on open source scripts written in PxL, Pixie's proprietary query language. The default script is px/cluster, which shows cluster-level information including: A service map Nodes Namespaces Services Pods Step 5 of 14 Scroll down to see the error rates for your services: Yikes! You have three services returning a high percentage of errors: fetch-service frontend-service gateway-service You know that the website lives at frontend-service. You can reasonably rule this out as the culprit because you know it renders other hats just fine. That leaves two potential problem services: gateway-service fetch-service Step 6 of 14 To decide which service to look at first, scroll up to NAMESPACES and choose default: Your app services live in the default namespace. This helps you filter the service map to show more useful nodes. Step 7 of 14 Scroll up to the service map: Here, you see that the frontend-service requests data from gateway-service. In turn, gateway-service requests data from fetch-service. So, following that order of operations, focus first on the gateway-service. Tip You can click and drag the nodes in the service map to make it more readable. Step 8 of 14 Double click the gateway-service in your service map to learn more about it: Notice that Pixie's live debugger has seamlessly replaced namespace data with service data by changing the script: You're now using the px/service script filtered down to default/gateway-service. In this service, you see a graph with the errors, but not much about where those errors are coming from. Step 9 of 14 Click the script selector to switch to the px/service_stats script. Filter the svc to default/gateway-service: This gives a better picture of the errors in your service. Step 10 of 14 Scroll down to the Incoming Traffic and Outgoing Traffic tables: The gateway service is returning the same amount of errors on inbound requests as it's receiving from outbound requests to the fetch service. This is a good indicator that you need to look at what's happening upstream. Step 11 of 14 Switch to the px/http_data_filtered script, targeting default/fetch-service and requests with a 400 response status code: Step 12 of 14 Click on a row to learn more about a request to the fetch service that resulted in an error: Here, you see that the request path looks like /fetch?style=PIXIE&number=1. This looks right, because the hat style you chose is called PIXIE. So if the fetch service is still returning 400s, something wrong is happening when it tries to find the hat. Step 13 of 14 Switch to the px/mysql_data script and add a source filter for default/fetch-service: Many of these queries returned no results. Step 14 of 14 Click on one with no results, and look at the req_body to see the query: SELECT * FROM main.images WHERE BINARY description='pixie' AND approve='true' Copy There's the problem! The BINARY type cast effectively makes the WHERE condition case sensitive. Since the hat's style is called PIXIE, this condition fails to find it. Now that you know, you can fix this query in your fetch service. Summary To recap, you observed an error in your application and used Pixie in New Relic to: Understand your services' relationships Review the error percentages for each of your services Look at individual response bodies Find a semantic error in a query within one of those services And you didn't even need to individually install agents in any of your services. Pixie was able to deliver all the information you needed! lab This lesson is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie. Next, try to figure out why some APIs have high latency.",

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Set up your TinyHat environment, before starting this one. Your website, TinyHat.me, runs in Kubernetes. While Pixie helps you monitor your cluster and find the source of problems that arise within it, it's helpful to know about your cluster's structure and the components that make it up before learning how to use Pixie. Step 1 of 4 View your pods: bash Copy $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE add-service-5487c78c86-rsx2n 1/1 Running 0 10m admin-service-7cdcb754c9-blwpf 1/1 Running 0 10m fetch-service-68d9876b8b-2tb45 1/1 Running 5 10m frontend-service-649f75984b-xdgtg 1/1 Running 0 10m gateway-service-6bcb8bc8d5-hwxcl 1/1 Running 0 10m manipulation-service-75c4454b5d-687tf 1/1 Running 0 10m moderate-service-55985878d-td2tl 1/1 Running 0 10m mysql-576f9d87d9-45cc4 1/1 Running 0 10m simulator-554c8577-5nn52 1/1 Running 0 10m upload-service-7f68c55ddc-d5kd5 1/1 Running 0 10m Important Every pod should be running by now, but if one isn't, give it few more minutes. Here, you see nine containerized services and one simulator, each with their own pod. Instead of going into detail about the services now, you'll learn about them in context as you walk through this lab's scenarios. The simulator generates load to your website so you don't have to. Step 2 of 4 View your services next: bash Copy $ kubectl get services NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE add-service ClusterIP 10.108.136.0 <none> 80/TCP 13m admin-service ClusterIP 10.108.79.227 <none> 80/TCP 13m fetch-service ClusterIP 10.97.60.129 <none> 80/TCP 13m frontend-service LoadBalancer 10.106.184.90 10.106.184.90 80:32327/TCP 13m gateway-service LoadBalancer 10.108.122.133 10.108.122.133 80:30691/TCP 13m kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 15m manipulation-service ClusterIP 10.102.93.91 <none> 80/TCP 13m moderate-service ClusterIP 10.107.191.29 <none> 80/TCP 13m mysql ClusterIP 10.96.37.225 <none> 3306/TCP 13m upload-service ClusterIP 10.96.216.177 <none> 80/TCP 13m Here, you see your Kubernetes services. Notice that most of your app services have a corresponding Kubernetes service. One of these services is particularly important: frontend-service. This is a LoadBalancer that you connect to when you view your site. Step 3 of 4 Speaking of viewing your site, do that now by opening the EXTERNAL-IP that you see for frontend-service in your browser: Important If the frontend service's External-IP is pending, you probably forgot to minikube tunnel -p minikube-pixie-lab in another window. Step 4 of 4 Select a number of hats to display and a hat type. Then, select Hat Me: Now Bob Ross is wearing the hat(s) that you selected. Cool, right? With a better understanding of your cluster's resources and your website, you're better prepared to install Pixie and use it to monitor and debug your application when problems arise. lab This procedure is part of a course that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie.

Before you learn how you can use Pixie to monitor your Kubernetes clusters, you need to set one up. We've designed a cluster for you to use in this lab. Step 1 of 3 Clone pixie-lab-materials from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/pixie-lab-materials This repository contains all the code you need to complete this lab. Step 2 of 3 Change to the main directory, and run the setup script: bash Copy $ cd pixie-lab-materials/main $ ./setup.sh This script spins up a new minikube cluster using the Pixie-supported hyperkit driver. It also configures your network memory and CPU with limits that work well with this lab. Finally, it creates all the pods and services that make up the TinyHat application. Tip If you're using linux, update setup.sh to use the kvm2 driver instead: bash Copy $ minikube start --driver=kvm2 --cni=flannel --cpus=4 --memory=8000 -p minikube-pixie-lab If you're missing any dependencies, see the requirements in the lab overview for installation links. Step 3 of 3 In a new terminal window, open a minikube tunnel: bash Copy $ minikube tunnel -p minikube-pixie-lab This exposes the load balancer services in your cluster so you can access them. Important You may have to provide your user's password to allow minikube to work. You should now have two terminal windows: One that contains your tunnel.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Instrument your cluster, before starting this one. Until now, you've been working with application services that don't have bugs (we hope). You've been able to access TinyHat.me and render Bob Ross with one or more silly hats without a hitch. But it's time to deploy some new code to your cluster. Change to the scenario-1 directory and set up your environment: bash Copy $ cd ../scenario-1 $ ./setup.sh Please wait while we update your lab environment. deployment.apps/fetch-service configured deployment.apps/simulator configured Done! Uh oh! You look on social media and see some confused customers: What's wrong with TinyHat.me? Use Pixie to find out. Reproduce the issue You've been notified by your users that they can't see a particular hat on TinyHat.me. Before you start debugging your code, reproduce the issue for yourself. Step 1 of 5 Look up your frontend's external IP address: bash Copy $ kubectl get services NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE add-service ClusterIP 10.109.114.34 <none> 80/TCP 20m admin-service ClusterIP 10.110.29.145 <none> 80/TCP 20m fetch-service ClusterIP 10.104.224.242 <none> 80/TCP 20m frontend-service LoadBalancer 10.102.82.89 10.102.82.89 80:32161/TCP 20m gateway-service LoadBalancer 10.101.237.225 10.101.237.225 80:32469/TCP 20m kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 20m manipulation-service ClusterIP 10.107.23.237 <none> 80/TCP 20m moderate-service ClusterIP 10.105.207.153 <none> 80/TCP 20m mysql ClusterIP 10.97.194.23 <none> 3306/TCP 20m upload-service ClusterIP 10.108.113.235 <none> 80/TCP 20m Step 2 of 5 Paste the IP in your browser: This looks the same as it did before, except that there's a new hat style, called PIXIE. Step 3 of 5 Select a number of hats, the PIXIE style, and Hat me: Oops! Where did Bob go? Instead of rendering Bob Ross with your hat selection, the frontend served no image at all. Tip The number of hats you choose to display has no effect on the result. Step 4 of 5 Observe a network request in your browser's developer tools: Here, the response from the image request says, \"This hat style does not exist! If you want this style - try submitting it.\" You know that the PIXIE hat style most certainly does exist because you chose it from the selector. But for some reason, the application can't render the image. Step 5 of 5 For good measure, try to render a different hat style: It worked! Your users were right. There's something wrong with your application. Solve the mystery with Pixie The bad news is that you've confirmed there's an error in your application. The good news is that you recently instrumented your cluster with Pixie! Go to New Relic and sign into your account, if you haven't already. Step 1 of 14 From the New Relic homepage, go to Kubernetes: Step 2 of 14 Choose your tiny-hat cluster: Step 3 of 14 Then click Live Debugging with Pixie: This is Pixie's live, code-level debugger: You use it to drill down and learn more about the services in your cluster. Important When you go to the live debugger, you may see an error saying your cluster is disconnected. This is normal, as it takes a little while for New Relic to start seeing your Pixie data. Wait a few more minutes and refresh the debugger. Step 4 of 14 Notice the script dropdown menu at the top of the debugger: Pixie's live debugger renders data based on open source scripts written in PxL, Pixie's proprietary query language. The default script is px/cluster, which shows cluster-level information including: A service map Nodes Namespaces Services Pods Step 5 of 14 Scroll down to see the error rates for your services: Yikes! You have three services returning a high percentage of errors: fetch-service frontend-service gateway-service You know that the website lives at frontend-service. You can reasonably rule this out as the culprit because you know it renders other hats just fine. That leaves two potential problem services: gateway-service fetch-service Step 6 of 14 To decide which service to look at first, scroll up to NAMESPACES and choose default: Your app services live in the default namespace. This helps you filter the service map to show more useful nodes. Step 7 of 14 Scroll up to the service map: Here, you see that the frontend-service requests data from gateway-service. In turn, gateway-service requests data from fetch-service. So, following that order of operations, focus first on the gateway-service. Tip You can click and drag the nodes in the service map to make it more readable. Step 8 of 14 Double click the gateway-service in your service map to learn more about it: Notice that Pixie's live debugger has seamlessly replaced namespace data with service data by changing the script: You're now using the px/service script filtered down to default/gateway-service. In this service, you see a graph with the errors, but not much about where those errors are coming from. Step 9 of 14 Click the script selector to switch to the px/service_stats script. Filter the svc to default/gateway-service: This gives a better picture of the errors in your service. Step 10 of 14 Scroll down to the Incoming Traffic and Outgoing Traffic tables: The gateway service is returning the same amount of errors on inbound requests as it's receiving from outbound requests to the fetch service. This is a good indicator that you need to look at what's happening upstream. Step 11 of 14 Switch to the px/http_data_filtered script, targeting default/fetch-service and requests with a 400 response status code: Step 12 of 14 Click on a row to learn more about a request to the fetch service that resulted in an error: Here, you see that the request path looks like /fetch?style=PIXIE&number=1. This looks right, because the hat style you chose is called PIXIE. So if the fetch service is still returning 400s, something wrong is happening when it tries to find the hat. Step 13 of 14 Switch to the px/mysql_data script and add a source filter for default/fetch-service: Many of these queries returned no results. Step 14 of 14 Click on one with no results, and look at the req_body to see the query: SELECT * FROM main.images WHERE BINARY description='pixie' AND approve='true' Copy There's the problem! The BINARY type cast effectively makes the WHERE condition case sensitive. Since the hat's style is called PIXIE, this condition fails to find it. Now that you know, you can fix this query in your fetch service. Summary To recap, you observed an error in your application and used Pixie in New Relic to: Understand your services' relationships Review the error percentages for each of your services Look at individual response bodies Find a semantic error in a query within one of those services And you didn't even need to individually install agents in any of your services. Pixie was able to deliver all the information you needed! lab This lesson is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie.

      "body": "lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie. Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Instrument your cluster, before starting this one. Until now, you've been working with application services that don't have bugs (we hope). You've been able to access TinyHat.me and render Bob Ross with one or more silly hats without a hitch. But it's time to deploy some new code to your cluster. Change to the scenario-1 directory and set up your environment: bash Copy $ cd ../scenario-1 $ ./setup.sh Please wait while we update your lab environment. deployment.apps/fetch-service configured deployment.apps/simulator configured Done! Uh oh! You look on social media and see some confused customers: What's wrong with TinyHat.me? Use Pixie to find out. Reproduce the issue You've been notified by your users that they can't see a particular hat on TinyHat.me. Before you start debugging your code, reproduce the issue for yourself. Step 1 of 5 Look up your frontend's external IP address: bash Copy $ kubectl get services NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE add-service ClusterIP 10.109.114.34 <none> 80/TCP 20m admin-service ClusterIP 10.110.29.145 <none> 80/TCP 20m fetch-service ClusterIP 10.104.224.242 <none> 80/TCP 20m frontend-service LoadBalancer 10.102.82.89 10.102.82.89 80:32161/TCP 20m gateway-service LoadBalancer 10.101.237.225 10.101.237.225 80:32469/TCP 20m kubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 20m manipulation-service ClusterIP 10.107.23.237 <none> 80/TCP 20m moderate-service ClusterIP 10.105.207.153 <none> 80/TCP 20m mysql ClusterIP 10.97.194.23 <none> 3306/TCP 20m upload-service ClusterIP 10.108.113.235 <none> 80/TCP 20m Step 2 of 5 Paste the IP in your browser: This looks the same as it did before, except that there's a new hat style, called PIXIE. Step 3 of 5 Select a number of hats, the PIXIE style, and Hat me: Oops! Where did Bob go? Instead of rendering Bob Ross with your hat selection, the frontend served no image at all. Tip The number of hats you choose to display has no effect on the result. Step 4 of 5 Observe a network request in your browser's developer tools: Here, the response from the image request says, \"This hat style does not exist! If you want this style - try submitting it.\" You know that the PIXIE hat style most certainly does exist because you chose it from the selector. But for some reason, the application can't render the image. Step 5 of 5 For good measure, try to render a different hat style: It worked! Your users were right. There's something wrong with your application. Solve the mystery with Pixie The bad news is that you've confirmed there's an error in your application. The good news is that you recently instrumented your cluster with Pixie! Go to New Relic and sign into your account, if you haven't already. Step 1 of 14 From the New Relic homepage, go to Kubernetes: Step 2 of 14 Choose your tiny-hat cluster: Step 3 of 14 Then click Live Debugging with Pixie: This is Pixie's live, code-level debugger: You use it to drill down and learn more about the services in your cluster. Important When you go to the live debugger, you may see an error saying your cluster is disconnected. This is normal, as it takes a little while for New Relic to start seeing your Pixie data. Wait a few more minutes and refresh the debugger. Step 4 of 14 Notice the script dropdown menu at the top of the debugger: Pixie's live debugger renders data based on open source scripts written in PxL, Pixie's proprietary query language. The default script is px/cluster, which shows cluster-level information including: A service map Nodes Namespaces Services Pods Step 5 of 14 Scroll down to see the error rates for your services: Yikes! You have three services returning a high percentage of errors: fetch-service frontend-service gateway-service You know that the website lives at frontend-service. You can reasonably rule this out as the culprit because you know it renders other hats just fine. That leaves two potential problem services: gateway-service fetch-service Step 6 of 14 To decide which service to look at first, scroll up to NAMESPACES and choose default: Your app services live in the default namespace. This helps you filter the service map to show more useful nodes. Step 7 of 14 Scroll up to the service map: Here, you see that the frontend-service requests data from gateway-service. In turn, gateway-service requests data from fetch-service. So, following that order of operations, focus first on the gateway-service. Tip You can click and drag the nodes in the service map to make it more readable. Step 8 of 14 Double click the gateway-service in your service map to learn more about it: Notice that Pixie's live debugger has seamlessly replaced namespace data with service data by changing the script: You're now using the px/service script filtered down to default/gateway-service. In this service, you see a graph with the errors, but not much about where those errors are coming from. Step 9 of 14 Click the script selector to switch to the px/service_stats script. Filter the svc to default/gateway-service: This gives a better picture of the errors in your service. Step 10 of 14 Scroll down to the Incoming Traffic and Outgoing Traffic tables: The gateway service is returning the same amount of errors on inbound requests as it's receiving from outbound requests to the fetch service. This is a good indicator that you need to look at what's happening upstream. Step 11 of 14 Switch to the px/http_data_filtered script, targeting default/fetch-service and requests with a 400 response status code: Step 12 of 14 Click on a row to learn more about a request to the fetch service that resulted in an error: Here, you see that the request path looks like /fetch?style=PIXIE&number=1. This looks right, because the hat style you chose is called PIXIE. So if the fetch service is still returning 400s, something wrong is happening when it tries to find the hat. Step 13 of 14 Switch to the px/mysql_data script and add a source filter for default/fetch-service: Many of these queries returned no results. Step 14 of 14 Click on one with no results, and look at the req_body to see the query: SELECT * FROM main.images WHERE BINARY description='pixie' AND approve='true' Copy There's the problem! The BINARY type cast effectively makes the WHERE condition case sensitive. Since the hat's style is called PIXIE, this condition fails to find it. Now that you know, you can fix this query in your fetch service. Summary To recap, you observed an error in your application and used Pixie in New Relic to: Understand your services' relationships Review the error percentages for each of your services Look at individual response bodies Find a semantic error in a query within one of those services And you didn't even need to individually install agents in any of your services. Pixie was able to deliver all the information you needed! lab This lesson is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie.

      "body": "Our Couchbase integration collects and sends inventory and metric data from your Couchbase cluster to the New Relic platform, where you can quickly see the health of your Couchbase environment. We collect data at the cluster, node, query engine, and bucket level so you can trace a problem to its source. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Couchbase version 4.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Couchbase is not running on Kubernetes, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running Couchbase. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Couchbase cluster quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Couchbase integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Couchbase cluster. Install and activate To install the Couchbase integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-couchbase. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp couchbase-config.yml.sample couchbase-config.yml Copy Edit the couchbase-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-couchbase .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-couchbase/nri-couchbase-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-couchbase-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp couchbase-config.yml.sample couchbase-config.yml Copy Edit the couchbase-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, couchbase-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Couchbase are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Couchbase instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Couchbase Instance Settings The Couchbase integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where Couchbase is running. localhost M/I PORT Port on which Couchbase API is listening. 8091 M/I QUERY_PORT Port on which Couchbase N1QL service is listening. 8093 M/I USERNAME Username for accessing Couchbase API. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A M/I USE_SSL Use SSL when communicating with the Couchbase. false M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Location of SSL certificate on the host. Only required if USE_SSL is true. N/A M/I CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M/I TIMEOUT Timeout for API requests, in seconds. 30 M/I ENABLE_BUCKETS If true, collects bucket resources. true M ENABLE_BUCKET_STATS If true, collects additional bucket statistics. true M ENABLE_CLUSTER_AND_NODES If true, collects cluster and node resources. true M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-couchbase env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 8091 QUERY_PORT: 8093 USERNAME: couchbase_user PASSWORD: couchbase_password interval: 15s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/couchbase Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 15 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-couchbase env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 8091 QUERY_PORT: 8093 USERNAME: couchbase_user PASSWORD: couchbase_password interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-couchbase env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 8091 QUERY_PORT: 8093 USERNAME: couchbase_user PASSWORD: couchbase_password interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/couchbase Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable COUCHBASE_HOST to populate the HOSTNAME setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-couchbase env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: {{COUCHBASE_HOST}} PORT: 8091 QUERY_PORT: 8093 USERNAME: couchbase_user PASSWORD: couchbase_password interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Couchbase servers from the same integration. For the first instance (HOSTNAME: 1st_couchbase_host) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (HOSTNAME: 2nd_couchbase_host) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-couchbase env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: 1st_couchbase_host PORT: 8091 QUERY_PORT: 8093 USERNAME: couchbase_user PASSWORD: couchbase_password interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-couchbase env: INVENTORY: \"true\" HOSTNAME: 1st_couchbase_host PORT: 8091 QUERY_PORT: 8093 USERNAME: couchbase_user PASSWORD: couchbase_password interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/couchbase - name: nri-couchbase env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: 2nd_couchbase_host PORT: 8091 QUERY_PORT: 8093 USERNAME: couchbase_user PASSWORD: couchbase_password interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Integration data is reported to integration dashboards. Couchbase data is attached to the following event types: CouchbaseBucketSample CouchbaseClusterSample CouchbaseNodeSample CouchbaseQueryEngineSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Couchbase integration collects the following metric data attributes.

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations and quickstarts for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to diagnose common issues using New Relic. Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, View your services, before starting this one. In this procedure, you use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Diagnose high response times in Telco Lite Step 1 of 10 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services: The overview includes the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services. Step 2 of 10 On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: Here, you see that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. Step 3 of 10 From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Step 4 of 10 Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. Next, drill into the fulfillment service for even more information. Step 5 of 10 Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: You're now looking at the main:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Step 6 of 10 Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole: Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs and tables it shows, such as Throughput, Error rate, and Hosts. Next, look at the host to see what's happening. Step 7 of 10 First, switch to the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Step 8 of 10 Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Step 9 of 10 Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Step 10 of 10 Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes.

      "body": "lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to diagnose common issues using New Relic. Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, Diagnose high response time, before starting this one. In this procedure, you use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Diagnose error alerts in Telco Lite Step 1 of 16 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu to see an overview of all Telco Lite services including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 16 Select the Telco-Web Portal service name: You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed. Step 3 of 16 From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Step 4 of 16 Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you better understand what happened during that request. Step 5 of 16 Select the Errors column header twice to order the table by descending counts: Step 6 of 16 Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Step 7 of 16 Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Step 8 of 16 Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service: Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Web transactions time, in APM, also shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. Next, explore JVMs to see what's happening. Step 9 of 16 Open Monitor > JVMs in the left-hand navigation: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Step 10 of 16 Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. The next step is to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Step 11 of 16 You need to navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Step 12 of 16 Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Important Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Step 13 of 16 Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 14 of 16 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. Step 15 of 16 To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is affecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 16 of 16 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise critical violation alerts The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, View your services, before starting this one. In this procedure, you use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Diagnose high response times in Telco Lite Step 1 of 10 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services: The overview includes the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services. Step 2 of 10 On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: Here, you see that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. Step 3 of 10 From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Step 4 of 10 Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. Next, drill into the fulfillment service for even more information. Step 5 of 10 Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: You're now looking at the main:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Step 6 of 10 Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole: Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs and tables it shows, such as Throughput, Error rate, and Hosts. Next, look at the host to see what's happening. Step 7 of 10 First, switch to the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Step 8 of 10 Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Step 9 of 10 Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Step 10 of 10 Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes.

The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 16 Select the Telco-Web Portal service name: You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed. Step 3 of 16 From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Step 4 of 16 Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you better understand what happened during that request. Step 5 of 16 Select the Errors column header twice to order the table by descending counts: Step 6 of 16 Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Step 7 of 16 Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Step 8 of 16 Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service: Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Web transactions time, in APM, also shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. Next, explore JVMs to see what's happening. Step 9 of 16 Open Monitor > JVMs in the left-hand navigation: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Step 10 of 16 Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. The next step is to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Step 11 of 16 You need to navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Step 12 of 16 Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Important Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Step 13 of 16 Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 14 of 16 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. Step 15 of 16 To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is affecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 16 of 16 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise critical violation alerts The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to diagnose common issues using New Relic. Now that you've diagnosed all the issues affecting Telco Lite, tear down your services.",

      "body": "lab This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to diagnose common issues using New Relic. Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, View your services, before starting this one. In this procedure, you use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Diagnose high response times in Telco Lite Step 1 of 10 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services: The overview includes the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services. Step 2 of 10 On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: Here, you see that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. Step 3 of 10 From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Step 4 of 10 Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. Next, drill into the fulfillment service for even more information. Step 5 of 10 Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: You're now looking at the main:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Step 6 of 10 Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole: Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs and tables it shows, such as Throughput, Error rate, and Hosts. Next, look at the host to see what's happening. Step 7 of 10 First, switch to the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Step 8 of 10 Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Step 9 of 10 Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Step 10 of 10 Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes.
