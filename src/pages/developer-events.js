                Nerd Days is a FREE engineering conference that kicks off
                October 13 (Dates vary by region). Focused on building more
                perfect software, our goal is to spend less time looking at
                slides that tell you what software can do and more time on
                getting your hands on the software to solve problems
                efficiently.
