<Intro>

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. You can use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic entities.

In this guide you'll learn how to set up New Relic for the first time with the official [New Relic Kubernetes operator](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-kubernetes-operator). More specifically, you'll provision an alert policy with NRQL conditions in your New Relic account using Kubernetes.

</Intro>

## Before you begin

This walkthrough assumes you’ve already deployed a Kubernetes cluster. You could even create a local cluster on your machine with [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).
To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Kubernetes. To complete the full exercise, you’ll need to:

- Deploy a New Relic agent if you haven't done so yet. [Install New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent) for your application.
- [Install `kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and point it at the correct cluster; this determines the cluster where you’ll install the New Relic operator.
- [Install `kustomize`](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/installation/).

<Steps>
<Step>

## Installing the operator on your Kubernetes cluster

First, install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/), which automatically provisions and manages TLS certificates in Kubernetes.

```bash lineNumbers=false
kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.15.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

Next, install the Kubernetes operator.

```bash lineNumbers=false
kustomize build https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-kubernetes-operator/config/default | kubectl apply -f -
```

To confirm the installation was successful, run a few `kubectl` commands to check the status of the Kubernetes operator.
Ensure the Kubernetes operator's namespace, `newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system`, has been applied:

```bash lineNumbers=false
kubectl get namespaces
```

The output should be similar to the following, which includes the Kubernetes operator's namespace, `newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system`:

```no-highlighting lineNumbers=false
NAME                                     STATUS   AGE
cert-manager                             Active   4m35s
default                                  Active   20m
kube-node-lease                          Active   20m
kube-public                              Active   20m
kube-system                              Active   20m
newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system      Active   3m48s
```

Now, make sure the Kubernetes operator's controller manager is running:

<small>
  <em>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Don't forget to include the{' '}
    <tt>--namespace (shorthand -n)</tt> option when running kubectl get pods to
    ensure you're inspecting resources within the correct namespace.
  </em>
</small>

```bash lineNumbers=false
kubectl get pods --namespace newrelic-kubernetes-operator-system
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```no-highlighting lineNumbers=false
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-7b9c64f58crwg9j   2/2     Running   0          157m
```

If your output is similar to the example shown, you’re ready for the next step. If you don’t see a pod named `newrelic-kubernetes-operator-controller-manager-<hash>`, double check your Kubernetes configuration to ensure you’re within the correct context and pointing to the correct cluster.

</Step>
<Step>

## Creating your first alert policy

To kick things off, start small. First, create an alert policy with the minimum required configuration, then add a NRQL alert condition to the policy, which will add the condition to the policy in New Relic.
A minimal alert policy configuration is represented in the code below. For the sake of this walkthrough, name this file `new_relic_alert_policy.yaml`.

<small>
  <em>
    <strong>Note</strong>: For help locating your personal API key, check out
    New Relic's{' '}
    <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#">
      personal API key documentation
    </a>
    .
  </em>
</small>

```yaml lineNumbers=false
apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1
kind: AlertsPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-policy
spec:
  account_id: <your New Relic account ID>
  api_key: <your New Relic personal API key>
  name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename
  region: 'us'
```

Now run the `kubectl apply` command to create your alert policy.

```bash lineNumbers=false
kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml
```

You'll see output that reads similar to the following:

```bash lineNumbers=false
alertspolicy.nr.k8s.newrelic.com/my-policy created
```

Confirm that your alert policy was created by viewing your policies at `alerts.newrelic.com/accounts/{your account ID}/policies`. You can search for your new policy by its name. In this case, search for "Alert Policy Created With k8s."

You should see your new alert policy. Next it’s time to add a NRQL alert condition to the policy using the same configuration file.

</Step>
<Step>

## Add NRQL alert conditions to your alert policy

In the previous section you created an alert policy; now, you’ll add some alert conditions to the policy so you can trigger alerts when certain metrics are out of line.
In your `new_relic_alert_policy.yaml` file, add a NRQL alert condition to the policy that will alert you when an application's average overall response time is above five seconds for a three minute period.

<em>
  <small>
    <strong>Note</strong>: To receive notifications when an alert is triggered,
    add{' '}
    <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts">
      notification channels
    </a>{' '}
    to your alert policy, with this code.
  </small>
</em>

```yaml lineNumbers=false
# The policy from the previous steps
apiVersion: nr.k8s.newrelic.com/v1
kind: AlertsPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-policy
spec:
  account_id: <your New Relic account ID>
  api_key: <your New Relic personal API key>
  name: 'Alert Policy Created With k8s' # Feel free to rename
  region: 'us'

  # Add a NRQL alert condition to the policy
  conditions:
    - spec:
        type: 'NRQL'
        name: 'NRQL Alert Condition Created With k8s'
        nrql:
          query: "SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'YOUR APP NAME'"
          evaluationOffset: 3
        enabled: true
        terms:
          - threshold: '5'
            threshold_occurrences: 'ALL'
            threshold_duration: 180
            priority: 'CRITICAL'
            operator: 'ABOVE'
        violationTimeLimit: 'ONE_HOUR'
        valueFunction: 'SINGLE_VALUE'
```

With the alert condition added to the configuration, you can apply the update, which will create a NRQL alert condition and add it to your policy.

```bash lineNumbers=false
kubectl apply -f ./new_relic_alert_policy.yaml
```

To confirm that the NRQL alert condition was created successfully, refresh your alert policy. If you see a new alert condition added to the alert policy, it was a success.

To finish things off, you'll create and add an alert channel to your alert policy. For example, maybe you want to send an email out to your team when your alert condition is triggered.

## What’s next?

Nice work — now you can manage your New Relic alert policies and NRQL alert conditions with code that integrates seamlessly within your Kubernetes workflow. This provides the ability to configure and manage your alerts with a domain-specific pattern, providing consistency and maintainability. You also gain the benefits of code reviews for any potential changes moving forward.
As you and your team move forward, you might need to adjust some of the configuration values to better fit your needs.
The New Relic Kubernetes Operator is just one of several tools in the New Relic Developer Toolkit aimed at facilitating observability as code.
