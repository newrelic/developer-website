<Intro>

You need to pinpoint problems without filtering through a ton of noise. You want to automate observability the way you automate infrastructure management. Our developer toolkit provides tools to monitor, alert, and analyze your ecosystem in one place; to integrate New Relic into your existing workflows; to manage assets programmatically, from one client; and to provision a subset of New Relic resources. The guides in this section introduce the developer toolkit and help you  increase consistency and reduce toil.
