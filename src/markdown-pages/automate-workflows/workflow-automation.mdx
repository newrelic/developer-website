## Define and automate observability

As the maintainer of an increasingly complex software stack, you need to
pinpoint problems without filtering through all the noise. You need to automate
observability the way you automate infrastructure management, by embedding your
New Relic configuration in code. The [Terraform
Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/newrelic/index.html) enables
observability as code -- the ability to monitor, alert, and analyze your
ecosystem in one place, in real time. Built on the New Relic Client, the
Terraform Provider provides a full implementation of APIs that enable you to
create alert policies and conditions, Synthetic monitors and Synthetics alert
conditions, notification policies and more.

The [Terraform Provider getting started
guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/newrelic/guides/getting_started.html)
steps you through some fundamental configuration. The [New Relic APM Terraform
module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/newrelic/apm/newrelic/0.0.4)
provides a monitoring strategy for application resources reporting into New
Relic.

## Build event-based workflows

When you’re constantly releasing features, you need to easily track changes in
your environment and monitor your systems. The [New Relic
CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli) enables the integration of New
Relic into your existing workflows, from fetching data from your laptop while
troubleshooting an issue, to adding New Relic into your CI/CD pipeline. The CLI
is a supported library that consolidates New Relic tools, enabling you to
perform these tasks (and more):

* Search for entities across all your New Relic accounts
* Manage tags across all of your entities
* Record APM application deployments within New Relic

See the [New Relic CLI getting started
guide](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/blob/master/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
for steps to get set up, tag an application, tag all applications, or create a
deployment marker.

## Harness multiple APIs with a single client

The [New Relic Client](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-client-go) provides
the building blocks for many tools in the toolkit, enabling quick access to a
handful of New Relic APIs. The Client means you don’t have to toil over things
like serialization and authentication. Use it to record your application
deployments without having to learn how the API works. Or to automate changing
tags within New Relic when service ownership changes. And you can
programmatically manage your assets via APIs and auto-instrumentation within
your own custom applications.

The client provides full support for these New Relic API endpoints:

* [NerdGraph API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph), New Relic’s GraphQL API
* [REST v2 API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2)
* [Infrastructure API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/rest-api-calls-new-relic-infrastructure-alerts)
* [Synthetics API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api)

## Provision New Relic resources with AWS CloudFormation

If you’re a developer using AWS CloudFormation, the [New Relic CloudFormation
integration](https://github.com/newrelic/cloudformation-partner-integration)
enables you to provision a subset of New Relic resources. You can build on the
New Relic Client, and configure basic NRQL alerts.

For more information, see our [AWS CloudFormation
integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-cloudformation-integration)
documentation.
