<Intro>

[Tags](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your [entities](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic), which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation.

In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities.

</Intro>

## Before you begin

For this guide you need your New Relic [personal API Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key): Create it at the **Account settings** screen for your account.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Install the New Relic CLI

You can download the New Relic CLI via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (macOS), [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (Windows), and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/) (Linux). You can also download [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/releases) for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer.

- #### Linux

  With [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/) installed, run:

  `sudo snap install newrelic-cli`

- #### macOS

  With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, run:

  `brew install newrelic-cli`

- #### Windows

  With [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed, run:

  `scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git`<br />
  `scoop install newrelic-cli`

</Step><Step>

## Create your New Relic CLI profile

New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command.

To create your first CLI profile, run the [`profiles add`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/blob/master/docs/cli/newrelic_profile_add.md) command. Don't forget to set the [region](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers) of your New Relic account: use `-r` to set either `us` or `eu` (this is required).

```bash lineNumbers=false
# Create the tutorial account for the US region
newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us
# Set the profile as default
newrelic profiles default -n tutorial
```

</Step><Step>

## Search for an entity

Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the [Entity explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts).

In the terminal, run [`entity search`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/blob/master/docs/cli/newrelic_entity_search.md) to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with "test" in their name.

```bash lineNumbers=false
# Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities
newrelic entity search --name "test"
```

</Step><Step>

If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example.

Select an entity from the results and look for its `guid` value; the `guid` is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down.

```json lineNumbers=false copy=false
{
    "accountId": 123456789,
    "domain": "NR1",
    "entityType": "WORKLOAD_ENTITY",
    "guid": "F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E",
    "name": "Test workload",
    "reporting": true,
    "type": "WORKLOAD"
  },
```

</Step><Step>

## Add tags and tag lists to your entity

With your entity `guid`, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the [`entities tags create`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/blob/master/docs/cli/newrelic_entity_tags_create.md) command.

What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example:

`tag1:value1,tag2:value2`

<Important>
  Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the
  tags to get created.
</Important>

```bash lineNumbers=false
# Adding a single tag
newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value
# Adding multiple tags
newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test
```

</Step><Step>

## Check that the tags are there

To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the [`entity tags get`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/blob/master/docs/cli/newrelic_entity_tags_get.md) command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array.

`newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID`

<Tip>

Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the [`entity tags delete`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/blob/master/docs/cli/newrelic_entity_tags_delete.md) command followed by the same arguments you used to create them.

</Tip>

```json lineNumbers=false
[
  {
    "Key": "tag1",
    "Values": ["true"]
  },
  {
    "Key": "tag2",
    "Values": ["test"]
  },
  {
    "Key": "tag3",
    "Values": ["testing"]
  }
  // ...
]
```

</Step></Steps>

## Next steps

Have a look at [all the New Relic CLI commands](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/blob/master/docs/cli/newrelic.md). For example, you could create a [New Relic workflow](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-one-workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster) using [`workload create`](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/blob/master/docs/cli/newrelic_workload_create.md).
