<Callout variant="course" title="lab">

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to diagnose common issues using New Relic.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, [_Diagnose error alerts_](/automate-workflows/diagnose-problems/error-alerts), before starting this one.

</Callout>

You've diagnosed all the issues affecting Telco Lite! In a real-life scenario, you'd now have enough information to resolve your bad user experiences. As this lab winds down, however, it's time to tear down your demo infrastructure so you avoid unnecessary costs.

## Tear down your services

<Callout variant='important'>

If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later.

</Callout>

Follow the [Teardown guide](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-catalog/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md#tear-down-your-resources) in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this lab, you:

- Used the `demo-deployer` to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud
- Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services
- Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial

Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services.

## Homework

To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the [catalog](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-catalog) and spin it up with the deployer!
