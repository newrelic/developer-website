<Intro>

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a popular infrastructure as code software tool by HashiCorp. You can use it to provision all kind of infrastructure and services, including New Relic entities.

In this guide you'll learn how to set up New Relic for the first time with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). More specifically, you are going to provision an alert policy with notifications in your New Relic account using Terraform.

</Intro>


## Before you begin

To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform.

* If you haven't deployed a New Relic agent yet, [install New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent) for your application. 
* [Install Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html).

<Steps>
<Step>

## Bootstrap your provider configuration

New Relic's Terraform Provider detects the environment variables above when running Terraform commands. 

You can set the environment variables in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.

Set the following environment variables:

* Set your [New Relic Personal API key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key) with the `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` environment variable.  Most Personal API keys begin with the prefix `NRAK-`.
* Set your [New Relic Admin API key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#admin) with the `NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable. Most Admin API keys begin with the prefix `NRAA-`.
* Set your [New Relic Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id) with the `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable.
* Set your New Relic [region](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers#verifying-account) with the `NEW_RELIC_REGION` environment variable.  Your region is `US` if your account settings page is located at `rpm.newrelic.com`, and `EU` if your account is located at `rpm.eu.newrelic.com`.

```bash lineNumbers=false
# Add this to your .bash_profile
export NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-...
export NEW_RELIC_ADMIN_API_KEY=NRAA-...
export NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345
export NEW_RELIC_REGION=US
# Or set it inline when running `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`:
$ NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... terraform apply
```
</Step>
<Step>

## Start with a provider configuration

To connect Terraform with New Relic, you need to set New Relic as a provider in your Terraform configuration file, so that Terraform can create and manage New Relic resources in your account.

To set New Relic as a provider, create a Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`). This code sets `newrelic` as the Terraform provider and provisions an empty [alert policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy) as the resource.

```hcl lineNumbers=false
provider "newrelic" {}

resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "alert_policy_name" {
  name = "My Alert Policy Name"
}
```

</Step>
<Step>

## Initialize and test your setup

After adding New Relic as a provider, [initialize](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) the working directory from the command line using `terraform init`.

Once you've successfully initialized the working directory, test Terraform's [execution plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) using `terraform plan` to confirm that you've the right setup.

```bash lineNumbers=false
# Initialize the working directory
$ terraform init

# Test the Terraform plan
$ terraform plan
```

`plan` performs a [dry run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_run_(testing)) of your Terraform configuration, so nothing is actually provisioned. Always run `plan` to test your configuration before applying it.
</Step>
<Step>

## Add a data source 

The alert policy you defined in `main.tf` does not contain any alert condition. You are going to add an alert condition linked to your application.

To store your application's information, you need to add a [data source](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/data-sources.html).

```hcl lineNumbers=false
provider "newrelic" {}

# Data Source
data "newrelic_entity" "app_name" {
  name    = "my-app" # This must be an exact match of your app name in New Relic (case sensitive)
  domain  = "APM"
  type    = "APPLICATION"
}

resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "alert_policy_name" {
  name = "My Alert Policy Name"
}
```
</Step>
<Step>

## Add an alert condition to the alert policy

Now you can add the alert condition. For example, you can create a `critical` alert condition that is triggered when the [Apdex](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measure-user-satisfaction) of your application falls below `0.75` for five minutes.

```hcl lineNumbers=false
provider "newrelic" {}

data "newrelic_entity" "app_name" {
  name    = "my-app"
  domain  = "APM"
  type    = "APPLICATION"
}

resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "alert_policy_name" {
  name = "My Alert Policy Name"
}

# Alert condition
resource "newrelic_alert_condition" "alert_condition_name" {
  policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.alert_policy_name.id

  name            = "My Alert Condition Name"
  type            = "apm_app_metric"
  entities        = [data.newrelic_entity.app_name.application_id]
  metric          = "apdex"
  runbook_url     = "https://www.example.com"
  condition_scope = "application"

  term {
    duration      = 5
    operator      = "below"
    priority      = "critical"
    threshold     = "0.75"
    time_function = "all"
  }
}
```
</Step>
<Step>

## Add a notification channel

Alert policies use [notification channels](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts) to inform you about incidents and active alerts. To add a notification channel to your alert policy, add the following snippet to your configuration file. 

When the alert condition is triggered, the notification channel sends an email to the specified `recipients`. You can send notifications using different tools and channels, such as Slack, by changing the `type` of your [alert channel](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/newrelic/r/alert_channel.html).

```hcl lineNumbers=false
# Notification channel
resource "newrelic_alert_channel" "alert_notification_email" {
  name = "paul@example.com"
  type = "email"

  config {
    recipients              = "fab@example.com"
    include_json_attachment = "1"
  }
}

# Link the above notification channel to your policy
resource "newrelic_alert_policy_channel" "alert_policy_email" {
  policy_id  = newrelic_alert_policy.alert_policy_name.id
  channel_ids = [
    newrelic_alert_channel.alert_notification_email.id
  ]
}
```

</Step>
<Step>

## Apply your Terraform configuration

The last step is provisioning the resources you've configured in `main.tf`, so that the alert policy is enabled in your New Relic account for your application.

To [apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html) the Terraform configuration and provision the resources in your New Relic account, run `terraform apply`.

Answer `yes` when prompted to apply the changes. Once the `apply` process is complete, you should see the new alert policy you've provisioned using Terraform, and its alert conditions, in your New Relic account.

You can run `terraform apply` every time you need to make changes to your configuration. To eliminate the resources you've provisioned, run [`terraform destroy`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/destroy.html).
</Step>

<Step>

## Optional: Use the `apm` module for faster configuration

In the Terraform Registry you can find [our `apm` module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/newrelic/apm/newrelic/0.0.4), which simplifies Terraform's configuration. `apm` creates an alert policy, a [Synthetics monitor](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors), and several alert conditions for a given application reporting data into New Relic.

To use our `apm` module with Terraform:

1. Set `newrelic/apm/newrelic` as the module source.
2. Add your `account_id` and `application_name`.
3. Define your `application_url` (if any).

Here is a configuration example with overridden default values. Initialize the working directory using `terraform init`to download and enable the module.

<Tip> 

The `apm` module doesn't create a notification channel, so you would still have to define one.

</Tip>

```hcl lineNumbers=false
data "newrelic_alert_channel" "pager" {
    name = "Page Developer Toolkit Team"
}

module "dummy-app-monitor" {
    source = "newrelic/apm/newrelic"

    account_id = 2520528
    application_name = "Dummy App"

    # An Apdex alert condition will be created with sensible defaults without the use of these attributes.
    apdex_warning_threshold = 0.9
    apdex_critical_threshold = 0.8

    # An error rate alert condition will be created with sensible defaults without the use of these attributes.
    error_rate_warning_threshold = 5
    error_rate_critical_threshold = 10

    # Specifying an application URL will provision a Synthetics monitor and associated alert condition.
    application_url = "https://www.dummyapp.com"
    synthetics_monitor_verify_ssl = true

    # Response time alert condition will not be provisioned unless a critical violation threshold is specified.
    response_time_critical_threshold = 3

    channel_ids = [data.newrelic_alert_channel.pager.id]
}
```

</Step></Steps>

## Tip: Avoid resources being marked as "sensitive"

When API results are deemed to be secret and are obfuscated, Terraform may be unable to detect the state of a resource, marking it as changed. Consider this example:

```hcl lineNumbers=false
resource "newrelic_alert_channel" "slack" {
  name = "slack"
  type = "slack"

  config {
    channel = "test"
    url     = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxx/xxxxx"
  }
}
```
<br />

Running `terraform plan` yields the following:

```
    -/+ newrelic_alert_channel.slack (new resource required)
          id:                    "2344397" => <computed> (forces new resource)
          config.%:              "1" => "2" (forces new resource)
          config.channel:        <sensitive> => <sensitive> (attribute changed)
          config.url:            <sensitive> => <sensitive> (forces new resource)
          name:                  "slack" => "slack"
          type:                  "slack" => "slack"
```
<br />

To prevent Terraform from wrongly marking a resource as changed, add an [`ignore_changes`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#ignore_changes) directive:

```hcl lineNumbers=false
resource "newrelic_alert_channel" "slack" {
  ...
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = ["config"]
  }
}
  ...
```
<br />

This avoids changes to resources caused by obfuscated items.
