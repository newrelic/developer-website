<Intro>

This guide steps you through adding access to the New Relic time picker to a sample transaction overview application. You also add the selected time to the queries used in the application’s chart components. Start by setting up the sample application and running it locally. Then add the time picker, and some time picker features.

- A github account
- New Relic developer account
- API Key
- New Relic One CLI downloaded

This is a step with no title or code snippet, only description. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer vel orci dignissim, egestas turpis non, ultricies erat. Nullam id magna molestie, volutpat ipsum vitae, bibendum ligula.
</Step>

<Step>

## Set up and run the application locally
Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal,  change to the time picker directory.

```shell lineNumbers=false
cd /nr1-howto/add-time-picker
```

Once that is done, run the following:

```shell lineNumbers=false
npm start
```
</Step>

<Step>

## Make sure you're getting data from the right New Relic account
In your preferred text editor, open the `/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js` and then edit the following line to use your account ID (find your account ID in the Profile section of the Developer Center, where you downloaded the New Relic One CLI):

```jsx
this.accountId = <REPLACE ME WITH YOUR ACCOUNT ID>;
```

</Step>

<Step>

Update the UUID and serve the application by running the following:

```shell lineNumbers=false
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### Next steps

You'll get a URL to access New Relic One and see your application running locally: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local

One the New Relic home page, there's a new launcher to the Add time picker application.

Click the launcher, and the dashboard opens with your New Relic account transactions.
