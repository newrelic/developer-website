This lesson is a part of our OpenTelemetry masterclass. If you haven't already, checkout the [chapter introduction](/opentelemetry-masterclass/fundamentals).

Each lesson in this lab builds on the last one, so make sure you learn about [the OpenTelemetry specification](/opentelemetry-masterclass/fundamentals/opentelemetry-specification) before proceeding with this one.

The data model specifies what telemetry data structures look like. In OpenTelemetry, these data structures are called signals. The **signals** that it supports align mostly with the telemetry data types you learned about earlier in this course: traces, metrics, and logs.

Each signal has its own data model specification that includes:

- **Semantic conventions:** Conventional attributes that describe common operations, technologies, events, and protocols
- **An OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) specification:** A description of how each data signal should be encoded and transferred over OpenTelemetry’s exchange protocol

To learn more specifically what a data model provides, look at the trace data model.
