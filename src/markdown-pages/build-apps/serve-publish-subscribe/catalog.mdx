<Intro>

Add screenshots, descriptions, and other metadata to your Nerdpack, and upload it all to the New Relic One catalog.

</Intro>

## Update your CLI

Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI:

```sh
nr1 update
```

## Check your permissions

To publish your Nerdpack and update its catalog information, you need:

- Access to the account that published it
- The [necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks](/build-apps/permission-manage-apps)

## Publish your Nerdpack

You need to [publish](/build-apps/publish-deploy/publish) Nerdpacks that you create before you can update their catalog information.

## Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata

After you've published your Nerdpack to the New Relic One catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations.

<Steps>

<Step>

Go to [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com):

![Homepage](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/home.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to **Apps**:

![Navigate to the Apps page](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/nav-to-apps.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Find your published Nerdpack under **New Relic One catalog**:

![Published Nerdpack](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/published-app.png)

Notice that there is no information on the **Apps** or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in _nr1.json_:

![Published Nerdpack](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/demo-app-no-details.png)

There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. To add these, your Nerdpack needs a _catalog_ directory.

</Step>

<Step>

From the root of your Nerdpack, create _catalog_ directories to house your Nerdpack's screenshots and metadata:

```sh
nr1 create --type catalog
[output] {success}✔{normal}  created: launchers/launcher/catalog
[output] {success}✔{normal}  created: nerdlets/home/catalog
[output]
[output] {success}✔{normal}  catalog created successfully!
[output]    {purple}catalog{normal} is available at "./catalog"
```

Inside your root _catalog_ directory, you'll find specific files and directories for portraying information about your Nerdpack to your users:

```sh
ls catalog
[output] README.md         additionalInfo.md config.json       documentation.md  {blue}screenshots
```

This command also generates a `catalog` directory for each launcher, nerdlet, and visualization in your Nerdpack. Inside you'll find a directory that allows you to add screenshots for each artifact.

```sh
ls launchers/launcher/catalog
[output] {blue}screenshots
[output]
ls nerdlets/home/catalog
[output] {blue}screenshots
```

</Step>

<Step>

Update your Nerdpack's _documentation.md_ file:

```md fileName=catalog/documentation.md
Enter your first and last name into the fields provided. When you're done, press **Submit** to see a personalized "Hello!" message.
```

</Step>

<Step>

Update your _config.json_ file:

```json fileName=catalog/config.json
{
  "tagline": "Say hi!",
  "details": "DemoApp says Hello to a user.",
  "repository": "https://github.com/newrelic/developer-website",
  "whatsNew": "feat: Initial commit"
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

Include screenshots in your root _screenshots_ directory or any Nerdpack item _screenshots_ directory.

</Step>

<Step>

Submit the information to the New Relic One catalog:

```sh
nr1 catalog:submit
[output] Uploading screenshots from demo-app...
[output]  {success}✔{normal}  Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app
[output] Uploading screenshots from demo-app/launchers/launcher...
[output]  {success}✔{normal}  Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/launchers/launcher
[output] Uploading screenshots from demo-app/nerdlets/home...
[output]  {success}✔{normal}  Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/nerdlets/home
[output]  {success}✔{normal}  Updated metadata for DemoApp 1.0.0
```

</Step>

<Step>

Go to the catalog to see your changes:

![DemoApp with a tagline](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/demo-app-tagline.png)

Click your Nerdpack to see the new details:

![App details](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/demo-app-details.png)

</Step>

</Steps>

## Update your Nerdpack's icons

Within a Nerdpack, you can set two types of icons:

- One for your entire Nerdpack, which represents your Nerdpack in the catalog
- One for each of your launchers, which represents your Nerdlets

Replace these icons and publish your Nerdpack to see the changes.

<Steps>

<Step>

Update the _icon.png_ in the root of your Nerdpack. This icon is used in the catalog and the Nerdpack's detail page.

</Step>

<Step>

If you're building a Nerdpack with one or more launchers, update the _icon.png_ in each of your launcher's subfolders.

</Step>

<Step>

Update your _package.json_ version:

```json fileName=package.json lineHighlight=4
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "demo-app",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nr1 nerdpack:serve",
    "test": "exit 0"
  },
  "nr1": {
    "uuid": "f2dbc999-e9a3-49b9-933d-5a704c6750bd"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "prop-types": "^15.6.2",
    "react": "^16.6.3",
    "react-dom": "^16.6.3"
  },
  "browserslist": ["last 2 versions", "not ie < 11", "not dead"]
}
```

This allows you to publish a new version of your Nerdpack.

</Step>

<Step>

[Publish](/build-apps/publish-deploy/publish) your Nerdpack:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:publish
```

</Step>

<Step>

Update your `whatsNew` string in _catalog/config.json_:

```json fileName=catalog/config.json
{
  "tagline": "Say hi!",
  "details": "DemoApp says Hello to a user.",
  "repository": "https://github.com/newrelic/developer-website",
  "whatsNew": "feat: Add new icons"
}
```

This will tell users what you added in the latest version of your Nerdpack.

</Step>

<Step>

Submit this new metadata to the catalog:

```sh
nr1 catalog:submit
[output] Uploading screenshots from demo-app...
[output]  {success}✔{normal}  Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app
[output] Uploading screenshots from demo-app/launchers/launcher...
[output]  {success}✔{normal}  Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/launchers/launcher
[output] Uploading screenshots from demo-app/nerdlets/home...
[output]  {success}✔{normal}  Screenshots uploaded from: demo-app/nerdlets/home
[output]  {success}✔{normal}  Updated metadata for DemoApp 1.0.1
```

</Step>

<Step>

Go to the catalog and [subscribe to your Nerdpack](/build-apps/publish-deploy/subscribe) to see your new icon:

![DemoApp catalog icon](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/demo-app-details-icon.png)

![DemoApp launcher icon](../../../images/serve-publish-subscribe/demo-app-launcher-icon.png)

</Step>

</Steps>

</Tutorial>

## Resolve issues with submitting catalog information

Sometimes, when you work with catalog metadata, you may run into issues. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues.

### Publish your Nerdpack

Remember that you can only submit catalog metadata for Nerdpacks that have already been published. If you try to submit information for a Nerdpack that hasn't been published, the CLI will try to help:

```sh
nr1 catalog:submit
[output] Uploading screenshots...
[output]  {error}›{normal}   Error: {error}1 error while updating DemoApp 1.0.0
[output]  {error}›

### Resize your images

Screenshots for the catalog must meet the criteria specified previously in this guide. If they don't, the CLI will try to help:

```sh
nr1 catalog:submit
[output] Uploading screenshots...
[output]  {error}›{normal}   Error: {error}2 errors while updating DemoApp 1.0.1
[output]  {error}›{normal}
[output]  {error}›{normal}   {blue}catalog/screenshots/screenshot.png
[output]  {error}›{normal}   {red}Invalid Screenshot: screenshot.png has a size ratio of 4:2. Update size ratio to 3:2.
[output]  {error}›{normal}
[output]  {error}›{normal}   {blue}catalog/screenshots/screenshot.png
[output]  {error}›{normal}   {red}Invalid Screenshot: screenshot.png has a width of 3054px. Update size to be between 1600px and 2400px.
[output]  {error}›{normal}   Code: UNKNOWN
```

### Check the length of your strings

Most of the content in _config.json_ has string-length requirements. Make sure you review those requirements and adhere to them when you update your _config.json_ file. Otherwise, you'll see errors when you try to submit your configuration to the catalog:

```sh
nr1 catalog:submit
[output] Uploading screenshots...
[output]  {success}✔{normal}  Screenshots uploaded
[output]  {error}›{normal}   Error: {error}2 errors while updating DemoApp 1.0.1
[output]  {error}›{normal}
[output]  {error}›{normal}   {blue}catalog/config.json
[output]  {error}›{normal}   {error}Invalid Metadata: `details` has a character length of 2204. Must be no longer than 1000 characters
[output]  {error}›{normal}

[output]  {error}›{normal}   {error}Invalid Metadata: `tagline` has a character length of 266. Must be no longer than 30 characters
