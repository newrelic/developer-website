<Intro>

Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder">chart builder</a> you can create tables from <a href="https://docs-dev.newrelic.com/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql">NRQL queries</a>. 

Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. 

In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various components of the <var>NR1</var> library.

</Intro>

## Before you begin

Follow the [instructions in New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) to create an API key and download and configure your NR1 CLI profile.
<br/>
This guide requires that you have Git and node.js installed on your machine.

<br/>

<Steps>
<Step>

## Clone the example application

In this guide you are going to experiment with tables. To do that, you need a New Relic One application you can modify and test on your computer. 

There's a demo application for you in the [nr1-how-to](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to) repository. Start by cloning the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory.

```sh lineNumbers=false copy=false
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git`
cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet`
```

</Step><Step>

Edit the `index.json` file and set `this.accountId` to [your Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id) as shown in the example.

```js lineNumbers=false
export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
        super(props)
        this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID;
    }
    ... 
}
```

</Step>
<Step>

## Run the demo application

Change the directory back to `nr1-how-to/create-a-table`.  Before you can load the demo application, you need to [update its unique id](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/guide-to-authentication--data-access--and-permissions) by invoking the NR1 CLI.

Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser.

```bash lineNumbers=false copy=false
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID
npm install           # Install dependencies
nr1 nerdpack:serve    # Serve the demo app locally
```

</Step>
<Step>

Open [one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) in your browser. You should see a **Create a table** button in your launcher: That's the demo application you are going to work on. Go ahead and select it.

![app-launcher](../images/nrone-table-guide/demo-app-button.png)

Have a good look at the demo app: There is a `TableChart` on the left side named **Transaction Overview**, with an `AreaChart` next to it. You are going to use `Table` components to add a new table in the second row.

![app-launcher](../images/nrone-table-guide/app-overview.png)

</Step>
<Step>

## Import the Table components

Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. 

Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example:

* `Table`
* `TableHeader`
* `TableHeaderCell`
* `TableRow`
* `TableRowCell`


```jsx lineNumbers=false
import {
    Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart,
} from 'nr1';
```

</Step>
<Step>

## Add a basic Table component
Locate the empty `GridItem` in `index.js`: This is where you start building the table. 

Add the initial `<Table>` component. The `items` property collects the data by calling `_getItems()`, which contains sample values.

```jsx  lineNumbers=false
<GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={12}>
    <Table items={this._getItems()}>
    </Table>
</GridItem>
```

</Step>
<Step>

## Add the header and rows

As the [`Table`](https://developer.newrelic.com/client-side-sdk/index.html#components/Table) component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows.

Inside of the `Table` component, add the `TableHeader` and then a `TableHeaderCell` child for each heading.

Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many `TableRows` as items returned by `_getItems()`.


```jsx lineNumbers=false
<TableHeader>
    <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell>
    <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell>
    <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell>
    <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell>
    <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell>
</TableHeader>
{({ item }) => (
    <TableRow>
        <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell>
        <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell>
        <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell>
        <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell>
        <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell>
    </TableRow>
)}

```

</Step>
<Step>

Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below.

</Step>
<Step>

## Replace standard table cells with smart cells

The NR1 library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names.

The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: **Application** (an entity name) and **Size** (a metric).

Before you can use `EntityTitleTableRowCell` and  `MetricTableRowCell`, you have to add them to the import statement first.

```jsx lineNumbers=false copy=false
import {
    EntityTitleTableRowCell,
    MetricTableRowCell,
    ... /* All previous components */
} from 'nr1';

```

</Step>
<Step>

Update your table rows by replacing the first and second `TableRowCell`s with entity and metric cells. 

Notice that [`EntityTitleTableRowCell`](https://developer.newrelic.com/client-side-sdk/index.html#components/EntityTitleTableRowCell) and [`MetricTableRowCell`](https://developer.newrelic.com/client-side-sdk/index.html#components/MetricTableRowCell) are self-closing tags.

```jsx lineNumbers=false
{({ item }) => (
    <TableRow>
        <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item}/>
        <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} />
        <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell>
        <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell>
        <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell>
    </TableRow>
)}

```

</Step>
<Step>

Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data.

</Step>
<Step>

## Add some action to your table!

Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row.

Add the `_getActions()` method to your `index.js` file, right before `_getItems()`. 

As you may have guessed from the code, `_getActions()` spawns an alert box when you click **Team** or **Commit** cells.

```jsx lineNumbers=false 
_getActions() {
    return [
        {
            label: 'Alert Team',
            iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT,
            onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => {
                alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`);
            },
        },
        {
            label: 'Rollback Version',
            iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO,
            onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => {
                alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`);
            },
        },
    ];
}

```

</Step>
<Step>

Find the  `TableRow`  component in your `return` statement and point the `actions`  property to `_getActions()`.

The `TableRow` actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an `onClick` callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed.

```jsx lineNumbers=false
<TableRow actions={this._getActions()}>
```

</Step>
<Step>

Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser.

## Next steps

You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

Keep exploring the `Table` components, their properties, and how to use them, in our [SDK documentation](https://developer.newrelic.com/client-side-sdk/index.html#components/Table).
