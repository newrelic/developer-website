<Callout variant="tip" title="Course">

This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the [course introduction](../../../ab-test).

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, [_Describe your app for the catalog_](../catalog), before starting this one.

</Callout>

In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the New Relic One catalog and submit those catalog details.

## Versions and tags

Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information:

- version
- tag

An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the nerdpack's root-level _package.json_ file. Every time you modify code in your nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in _package.json_. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version `1.0.1`.

An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version `0.0.1` of a work-in-progress application might be published with a `DEV` tag to indicate that it's in development.

<Callout variant="tip">

There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation.

</Callout>

## Publish your first application

<Steps>

<Step>

Change to the _publish_ directory of the [coursework repository](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course):

```sh
cd nru-programmability-course/publish
```

This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next.

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at `nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test`.

</Step>

<Step>

Generate your own app UUID:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf
```

The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Technical detail">

The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it.

</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

In _package.json_, set `version` to `1.0.0`:

```json filename=package.json lineHighlight=4
{
    "private": true,
    "name": "ab-test",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "nr1 nerdpack:serve",
        "test": "exit 0"
    },
    "nr1": {
        "uuid": "2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "prop-types": "^15.6.2",
        "react": "^16.6.3",
        "react-dom": "^16.6.3"
    },
    "browserslist": [
        "last 2 versions",
        "not ie < 11",
        "not dead"
    ]
}
```

New Relic One uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) and, under this convention, `1.0.0` signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish!

</Step>

<Step>

Publish your New Relic One application:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV
```

That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The `-t` parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console:

```sh
[output] Publishing Nerdpack AbTest ({blue}9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380{plain})
[output]  {success}✔{plain}  Nerdpack published successfully!
[output]  {success}✔{plain}  Tagged {blue}9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380{plain} version {green}1.0.0{plain} as {green}DEV{plain}.
```

For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as `DEV` because it's still a work in progress.

</Step>

<Step>

View your app's registry information:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:info
[output] Id: {blue}9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380
[output] Region: {muted}us
[output] Account ID: 123456
[output] Local version: 1.0.0
[output] Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED
[output] Version Count: 4
[output]
[output] Version  Date           Tags
[output] -------  -------------  ------
[output] 1.0.0    {muted}5 minutes ago  {green}DEV
```

The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID.

</Step>

</Steps>

## View your application in the catalog

Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the New Relic One app catalog.

<Steps>

<Step>

Go to [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com). Notice that you're not using the `?nerdpacks=local` querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally.

</Step>

<Step>

From the homepage, navigate to **Apps**:

![Navigate to Apps](../../../images/ab-test/nav-to-apps.png)

From here, you can see your application under **New Relic One catalog**:

![Your app in the catalog](../../../images/ab-test/app-in-catalog.png)

Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under **Your apps** instead.

</Step>

<Step>

Click on your app to see more details:

![App details](../../../images/ab-test/dev-version.png)

Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Submit catalog information

Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. `nr1 catalog` is used to submit and view this information.

<Steps>

<Step>

Submit your catalog information:

```sh
nr1 catalog:submit
[output] Uploading screenshots...
[output]  {green}✔  {plain}Screenshots uploaded
[output]  {green}✔  {plain}Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0
```

If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated.

You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog:

```sh
[output] Uploading screenshots...
[output]  {error}›   {plain}Error: {error}1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0
[output]  {error}›
[output]  {error}›   Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet?
[output]  {error}›   {plain}Code: UNKNOWN
```

If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application.

If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with `nr1 nerdpack:publish`.

</Step>

<Step>

View your catalog information:

```sh
nr1 catalog:info
[output] {purple}description: {plain}Nerdpack ab-test
[output] {purple}details: {plain}Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test
[output] {purple}displayName: {plain}AbTest

[output] {purple}whatsNew.version: {plain}1.0.0
```

All the information from _catalog_ shows here.

</Step>

<Step>

View your app in the catalog:

![Your app in the catalog with metadata](../../../images/ab-test/app-meta-in-catalog.png)

Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry.

Click on the app to see more:

![Your app details](../../../images/ab-test/app-about.png)

Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Update your version tag

Your app looks great in the catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as `DEV` because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag.

<Steps>

<Step>

Update your `1.0.0` app version from `DEV` to `STABLE`:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE
[output]  {success}✔{plain}  Tagged {blue}9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380{plain} version {green}1.0.0{plain} as {green}STABLE{plain}.
```

Without specifying a version, `nr1` uses the version specified in _package.json_. You can specify a version with the `-V` command. Learn more about `nerdpack:tag` with the `nr1 nerdpack:tag --help` command.

</Step>

<Step>

View your app information:

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:info
[output] Id: {blue}9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380
[output] Region: {muted}us
[output] Account ID: 123456
[output] Local version: 1.0.0
[output] Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED
[output] Version Count: 1
[output]
[output] Version  Date           Tags
[output] -------  -------------  ------
[output] 1.0.0    {muted}30 minutes ago  {green}STABLE
```

The app is now tagged with `STABLE`, indicating it's ready for public use.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Technical detail">

Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public New Relic One catalog.

</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application.
