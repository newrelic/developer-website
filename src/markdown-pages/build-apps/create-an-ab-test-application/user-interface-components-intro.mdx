This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the [course introduction](../../../ab-test).

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, [_Add a chart group_](../chart-group), before starting this one.

If an application is organized, it is more readable and more understandable. In your A/B test application, you have a lot of charts, but no organization. In the next few lessons, you’ll use user interface components to bring some organization to your application and provide new functionality. First, you’ll use a `Grid` component to arrange your charts to match the layout in your design guide. Second, you’ll add headings to clarify what each chart represents. Third, you'll add descriptions for your A and B design versions to the top of your app. Finally, you’ll create a section for ending your A/B test.

Before you add user any UI components to your application, remind yourself of how your application will look when you finish:

In the next lesson, you arrange your charts to look like they do in your design guide.
