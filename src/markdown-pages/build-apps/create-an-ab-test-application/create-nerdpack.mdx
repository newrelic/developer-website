This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the [course introduction](../../../ab-test).

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, [_Install and configure the New Relic One CLI_](../install-nr1), before starting this one.

A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI:

```bash
nr1 create --type nerdpack
```

When `nr1` prompts for a component name, use "ab-test" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you.

## Root directory

At the root level, you have a directory called _ab-test_. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack:

```bash
ls ab-test
[output] README.md         {blue}nerdlets{plain}          nr1.json          package.json
[output] {blue}launchers         node_modules{plain}      package-lock.json
```

`Readme.md` provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and `nr1 --help` are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool.

### Javascript files

_package.json_, _package-lock.json_, and *node_modules* are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at _nr1.json_, one of the most relevant files in this directory.

### Metadata file

_nr1.json_ is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's `displayName` to "A/B Test" and set the description to "A/B test your application using New Relic One":

```json fileName=nr1.json
{
    "schemaType": "Nerdpack",
    "id": "311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d",
    "displayName": "A/B Test",
    "description": "A/B test your application using New Relic One."
}
```

It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use.

Next, look at the _launchers_ and _nerdlets_ subdirectories.

## Launchers

_launchers_ is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. `nr1 create` only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it "ab-test-launcher". Inside its directory, there are two files:

- _icon.png_ is an image that represents the application
- _nr1.json_ is the launcher's metadata file

Use "A/B Test Launcher" for the launcher's `displayName` and "Open the A/B test Nerdlet" for the `description` in _nr1.json_:

```json fileName=launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json
{
    "schemaType": "LAUNCHER",
    "id": "ab-test-launcher",
    "displayName": "A/B Test Launcher",
    "description": "Open the A/B test Nerdlet",
    "rootNerdletId": "ab-test-Nerdlet"
}
```

Notice that the launcher has a `rootNerdletId`. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called `ab-test-nerdlet`, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the `rootNerdletId` to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open.

## Nerdlets

The _nerdlets_ directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since `ab-test-nerdlet` is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In _nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet_, there are three files:

- _index.js_ is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component
- _styles.scss_ holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet
- _nr1.json_ contains the Nerdlet's metadata

Update your Nerdlet's `displayName` to "A/B Test" and `description` to "Control and view results of your A/B test":

```json fileName=nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json
{
    "schemaType": "Nerdlet",
    "id": "ab-test-Nerdlet",
    "displayName": "A/B Test",
    "description": "Control and view results of your A/B test"
}
```

Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out _index.js_ to see what your default Nerdlet looks like:

```js fileName=nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js
import React from 'react';

export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>;
    }
}
```

Here, you have `AbTestNerdletNerdlet`, which `nr1` created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's _nr1.json_ file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading.

<Callout variant="tip">

In this lesson, you used `nr1 create` to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with `nr1 create`:

```sh
nr1 create --type nerdlet
nr1 create --type launcher
```

You can even skip the `--type` flag and select an option from a list:

```sh
nr1 create
[output] {green}?{plain} What kind of component do you want to create? {muted}› - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
[output]     nerdpack
[output] {green}❯   nerdlet{muted} - create a/an Nerdlet artifact inside your Nerdpack.
[output]     launcher
[output]     catalog
[output]     visualization
```

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!
