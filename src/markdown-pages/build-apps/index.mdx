<Intro>

New Relic offers a growing number of [open source apps](https://opensource.newrelic.com/explore-projects) designed to address monitoring needs for almost any situation. But you know better than anyone what information is crucial to your business, and how best to present it. Perhaps you want to aggregate global inventory trends into one view, or correlate diverse customer inputs using custom events. Our developer platform provides the tools to tailor existing apps, or build your own custom apps, so you can focus on the information you need. These guides are designed to help you start building apps, and dive into our library of components. The rest is up to you.
