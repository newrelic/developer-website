<Intro>

A [New Relic One application](https://developer.newrelic.com/use-cases/build-new-relic-one-applications
"Link opens in a new window.") is represented by a **Nerdpack** folder, which can include one or more **Nerdlet** files,
and (optionally) one or more **launcher** files. This document explains:

- The file structure for a [Nerdpack](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-application-nerdpack-file-structure#file-structure),
a [Nerdlet](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-application-nerdpack-file-structure#nerdlet-files)
and a [launcher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-application-nerdpack-file-structure#launcher-file)

## Generate Nerdpack components

There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template:

- Generate Nerdpack. Use the [CLI](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/cli "Link opens in a new window.") command `nr1 create` and select `Nerdpack` to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher.
- Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually. You can use the [CLI](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/cli "Link opens in a new window.") command `nr1 create` and choose to select either a Nerdlet or launcher. This may be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack.

For a lesson on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see [the workshop](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workshop/blob/master/lab0/INSTRUCTIONS.md "Link opens in a new window.") .

## Nerdpack file structure

When you generate a Nerdpack template using the CLI `nr1 create` command, it has this file structure:

## Nerdlet file structure

A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files:

### `index.js`

Here is what the default file looks like when a Nerdlet is generated with the CLI `nr1 create`:

 ```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>
  }
}
 ```

### `nr1.json`

Here is the default file generated by the CLI `nr1 create` command:

```json
{
  "schemaType": "NERDLET",
  "id": "my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet",
  "description": "Describe me",
  "displayName": "MyAwesomeNerdpack"
}
```

Besides using the [launcher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-application-nerdpack-file-structure#launcher-file)
as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with
a monitored entity to get it to appear in the New Relic One [entity explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts).
To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: `entities` and `actionCategory`.
In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all New Relic Browser-monitored
applications and will appear under the **Monitor** UI category :

```json
{
  "schemaType": "NERDLET",
  "id": "my-nerdlet",
  "description": "Describe me",
  "displayName": "Custom Data",
  "entities": [{"domain": "BROWSER", "type": "APPLICATION"}],
  "actionCategory": "monitor"
}
```
To see this application in the UI, you would go to the New Relic One
[entity explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts),
 select Browser applications, and select a monitored application.

### `styles.scss`

The file is provided for CSS styles (Sass SCSS syntax).

```css
/* this is an empty file you can use customize to style your nerdlet. */
```

### `icon.png`
![icon.png](../../images/nerdpack-file-structure/icon.png)
The launcher icon that appears on the [one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com/)
home page when an application is deployed.
