<Intro>

New Relic offers a variety of APIs you can use to:

- Retrieve data from New Relic.
- Send data to New Relic.
- Adjust settings.
- Set up automation.

This section of the Developer Site provides you references to where to find more
documentation on the different APIs you can use as a developer for your
different programmability use cases.

## Telemetry APIs

We offer several APIs that allow you to get MELT data types (metrics, events logs, and traces) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>

          Metric API
        </a>
      </td>
      <td>
        Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry
        monitoring services).
      </td>

## GraphQL API

NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools.

New Relic provides a powerful GraphQL tool to explore the API with embedded schema definitions. To get started, go to [New Relic's Graphiql Explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).

## Other REST APIs

New Relic has several APIs classified under our REST APIs which will allow you to interact with
resources such as [Insights](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-api) and [Synthetics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api). To explore these APIs go to [New Relic's REST API Explorer](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore)
