<Intro>

To build a [New Relic One app](/build-apps/build-hello-world-app), you must install the New Relic One CLI. The CLI helps you build, publish, and manage your New Relic app.

<br />

</Intro>

We provide a variety of tools for building apps, including the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). This page explains how to use [CLI commands](#new-relic-one-cli-commands) to:

- Generate Nerdpack/Nerdlet templates

- Locally serve Nerdpacks (when developing)

- Publish and deploy

- Subscribe to Nerdpacks

- Add screenshots and metadata to the catalog

## Installing the New Relic One CLI

In New Relic, click **Apps** and then in the **New Relic One catalog** area, click the [**Build your own application** launcher](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) and follow the quick start instructions. The quick start automatically generates an API key for the account you select, and gives you the pre-populated commands to create a profile, generate your first "Hello World" app, and serve it locally.

<Tip>

Use the [NR1 VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=new-relic.nr1) to build your apps.
