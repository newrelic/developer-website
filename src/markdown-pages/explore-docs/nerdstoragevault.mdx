<Intro>

To help you build a [New Relic application](/build-apps),
we provide you with the [New Relic One SDK](/explore-docs/intro-to-sdk).
On this page, youâ€™ll learn how to use NerdStorageVault to store data in an encrypted
storage solution.

</Intro>

## Using NerdStorageVault in your apps

NerdStorageVault is used to store and retrieve sensitive secrets data such as:

- personal access tokens
- license keys
- API keys
- other third party secrets

<Callout variant="tip">

NerdStorageVault is encrypted with AES-256 encryption

</Callout>

## Usage considerations

- This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack.
- NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack.
- You cannot make a direct query or mutation to NerdStorageVault.
- You can explore the fields and response types via the [NerdGraph API explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
- The only supported scope is ACTOR, or data that relates to a particular user.

## Component library

Currently NerdStorageVault is available in the alpha release of [Nr1 Community component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/nr1-community/v/1.3.0-alpha.5)
and is not available in the Nr1 core components library. Open source components can be use to augment
Nr1 core components for additional functionality.

## NerdGraph queries

Below are examples of the queries used by the components to interact with NerdStorageVault.

<Callout variant="tip">
  NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack.
</Callout>

### Write

```graphql
mutation {
  nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret(
    scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER }
    secret: { key: "test", value: "secret_test" }
  ) {
    status
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```

### Delete

```graphql
mutation {
  nerdStorageVaultDeleteSecret(
    scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER }
    key: "test_key"
  ) {
    status
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetch a single secret

```graphql
query {
  actor {
    nerdStorageVault {
      secret(key: "test_key") {
        key
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetch a list of secrets

```graphql
query {
  actor {
    nerdStorageVault {
      secrets {
        key
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Limits

- A maximum of 10 secrets can be stored per ACTOR.
- A secret value is limited to 5000 characters.
- A key value is limited to 64 characters.
- A key value must only include alphanumeric, '_' or '-' characters

### Permissions for working with NerdStorageVault

In order to persist changes to NerdStorageVault, such as writing, deleting,
and fetching data, you must have a
[user role with permission to persist changes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles).
