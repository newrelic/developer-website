## `nr1 nerdpack:build`

Builds a nerdpack

### Usage

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:build
```

### Options

|||
|---|---|
| `--extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path` | [default: extra-metadata.json] specify a json file path with extra metadata |
| `--prerelease=prerelease` | if specified, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be "1.2.3-abc". |
| `--profile=profile` | the authentication profile you want to use |
| `--verbose` | adds extra information to the output |

### Description

Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and css bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the `package.json` level of your Nerdpack. It will search for `nr1.json` files in your subdirectories, validate them, and try to build them. This also runs `nr1 nerdpack:validate` before starting the build process.

## `nr1 nerdpack:clean`

Removes all built artifacts

### Usage

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:clean
```

### Options

|||
|---|---|
| `--profile=profile` | the authentication profile you want to use |
| `--verbose` | adds extra information to the output |

### Description

Cleans and removes the content and the development folders (`dist/`, `tmp/`)

## `nr1 nerdpack:clone`

Clones a nerdpack from a git repository

### Usage

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:clone
```

### Options

|||
|---|---|
| `-f`, `--force` | Replace destination folder if it exists |
| `-p`, `--path=path` | Directory where to clone (defaults to the repository name) |
| `-r`, `--repo=repo` | (required) Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path) |
| `--profile=profile` | the authentication profile you want to use |
| `--verbose` | adds extra information to the output |

### Description

Given a git repository, it performs all the actions so that you can start using it. This includes, in order:

1. Clone the repository
2. Set the repository as remote upstream
3. Install all of its dependencies (using npm)
4. Generate a new UUID using your profile, and commit it

## `nr1 nerdpack:info`

Shows the state of your nerdpack in the new relic's registry

### Usage

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:info
```

### Options

|||
|---|---|
| `-a`, `--all` | show all versions |
| `-i`, `--nerdpack-id=nerdpack-id` | get info from the specified Nerdpack instead of local one |
| `--profile=profile` | the authentication profile you want to use |
| `--verbose` | adds extra information to the output |

### Description

The default amount of versions shown is 10 but all versions can be shown if the `--all` (or `-a`) flag is used

## `nr1 nerdpack:publish`

Publish this nerdpack

### Usage

nr1 nerdpack:publish
```

### Options

|||
|---|---|
| `-B`, `--skip-build` | skip the previous build process |
| `-T`, `--skip-tag` | do not tag the version |
| `-t`, `--tag=tag` | [default: STABLE] |
| `--dry-run` | publish process without actually publishing anything. |
| `--extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path` | [default: extra-metadata.json] specify a json file path with extra metadata |

| `--verbose` | adds extra information to the output |

### Description

If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically tag the nerdpack version as `STABLE`. If you want to disable this behavior, pass the `--skip-tag` flag to the command.

See `nr1 nerdpack:tag --help` for more info on tags.

## `nr1 nerdpack:serve`

Serves your nerdpack for testing and development purposes

### Usage

```sh
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

### Options

|||
