<Callout variant="course" title="lab">

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/collect-data/pixie).

</Callout>

Before you learn how you can use Pixie to monitor your Kubernetes clusters, you need to set one up. We've designed a cluster for you to use in this lab.

<Steps>

<Step>

Clone `pixie-lab-materials` from GitHub:

<>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/pixie-lab-materials
```

</>

This repository contains all the code you need to complete this lab.

</Step>

<Step>

Run the setup script to spin up a new minikube cluster:

<>

```bash
cd pixie-lab-materials
./setup.sh
```

</>

This uses the pixie-supported hyperkit driver and configures your network memory and CPU with limits that will work well with this lab.

<Callout variant="tip">

If you're using linux, use the `kvm2` driver instead. If you're missing any dependencies, see the [requirements](/collect-data/pixie/#requirements) in the lab overview for installation links.

</Callout>

It also deploys your TinyHat application to your cluster.

</Step>

<Step>

In a new terminal window, open a minikube tunnel:

<>

```bash
minikube tunnel -p minikube-pixie-lab
```

</>

This exposes the load balancer services in your cluster so you can access them.

<Callout variant="important">

You may have to provide your user's password to allow minikube to work.

</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

You should now have two terminal windows:

- One that contains your tunnel. This needs to remain open as long as you use your website.
- One for running the rest of the commands in this lab

In the next procedure, you familiarize yourself with your cluster and website.

This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your Kubernetes cluster with Pixie. Now that you've set up your environment, [explore your cluster](/collect-data/pixie/explore-cluster).
