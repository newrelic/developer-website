This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to get started with New Relic to monitor your application.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, [_Query custom Business Data_](/collect-data/monitor-your-application/query-custom-data), before starting this one.

With your app reporting server and browser-side performance data, you now have full visibility in your application. Happy with your current experinece, you came to know about New Relic alerts, and you've decided to add them.

With alerts, you monitor your services and receive notifications about problems that you're interested in, so that you can react fast to troubleshoot and resolve them.

This takes you to **Create an alert condition** page where you use NRQL to define your alert condition.

<Callout variant='tip'>

NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. Read our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) to know more about what it is and when to use it.

</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

Name your condition **High page load time**.

![Name your condition](../../../images/foodme/name-your-condition.png)

</Step>

Use the following NRQL to set up alert for high load load time. 

<>

```sql
SELECT average(duration) FROM BrowserInteraction WHERE appName='Relicstraunts'
```

</>

![NRQL alert condition](../../../images/foodme/high-page-load-nrql.png)
