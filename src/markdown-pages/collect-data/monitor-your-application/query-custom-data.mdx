This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your application with New Relic.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, [_Collect custom business data_](/collect-data/monitor-your-application/collect-custom-data), before starting this one.

</Callout>

With your app recording custom business data, you're now ready to get insights from your data. Particularly, you look up:

- Orders from the past 24 hours
- Most popular restaurants
- Most active customers
- Average order amount
- Customers that spend the most money
- Most popular items

In this procedure, you create a dashboard, query your custom data, gather it in charts, and add those charts to your dashboard to have quick view into these data points.
