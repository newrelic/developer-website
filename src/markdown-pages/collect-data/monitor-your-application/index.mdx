You're the developer of FoodMe, an [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) app that lets users order food from their favorite restaurants. Unfortunately, you've had no visibility into how your app is performing. Surprised by a recent spike in popularity, you've decided to start monitoring your application.

In this lab, you instrument your application with New Relic agents and monitor its metrics, logs, events, and transactions.
