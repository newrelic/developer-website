This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to instrument your application with OpenTelemetry. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/collect-data/opentelemetry-manual).

</Callout>

Before you can walk through this lab, you need to set up your development environment. Here, you:

1. Spin up your Python application
2. Send traffic to your app with a simple load generator

<Steps>

<Step>

Clone the lab repository:

<>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/otel-manual-instrumentation-lab-materials
```

</>

This repository contains a simple Python application, in _db.py_, that interacts with a trivial datastore:

<>

```py
import logging

class DuplicateKeyError(Exception):
    pass

class KeyDoesNotExistError(Exception):
    pass

db = {}

def read(key):
    """Read key from the database."""
    global db

    try:
        value = db[key]
        logging.debug("Successful read")
        return value
    except KeyError as ke:
        msg = f"Key `{key}` doesn't exist"
        logging.debug(msg)
        raise KeyDoesNotExistError(msg)

def create(key, value):
    """Write key:value to the database."""
    global db

    if key in db:
        msg = f"Key `{key}` already exists"
        logging.debug(msg)
        raise DuplicateKeyError(msg)

    db[key] = value
    logging.debug("Successful create")
    return value

def update(key, value):
    """Update key in the database."""
    global db

    if key in db:
        db[key] = value
        logging.debug("Successful update")
        return value

    msg = f"Key `{key}` doesn't exist"
    logging.debug(msg)
    raise KeyDoesNotExistError(msg)

def delete(key):
    """Delete key from the database."""
    global db

    if key in db:
        del db[key]
        logging.debug("Successful delete")
        return True

    return False
```

</>

It provides functions for reading, creating, updating, and deleting records from the database. Some of these functions raise exceptions when assumptions are violated, such as when a user tries to read a key that's not there.

The repository also includes a load generator, in _simulator.py_ that sends semi-random traffic to the database application.

</Step>

<Step>

Create a new [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments):

<>

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

</>

While you don't need to install dependencies now, you will soon. When you do, you'll want to install them into this virtual environment, rather than the global one.

</Step>

<Step>

Run the load generator:

<>

```bash
python simulator.py
```

</>

You should see debug logs detailing the responses from your database app:

<>

```bash
[output] DEBUG:root:Successful create
[output] DEBUG:root:Key `key1` doesn't exist
[output] DEBUG:root:Successful delete
[output] DEBUG:root:Key `key3` doesn't exist
[output] DEBUG:root:Key `key2` doesn't exist
[output] DEBUG:root:Successful create
[output] DEBUG:root:Successful create
```

</>

The simulator randomly chooses database actions to perform, so your output should look similar to this, but may not be identical.

</Step>

</Steps>

Now that you've got your application and load generator running, it's time to see what OpenTelemetry's all about.
