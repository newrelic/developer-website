<Intro>

This guide steps you through adding access to the New Relic time picker to a sample transaction overview application. You also add the selected time to the queries used in the applicationâ€™s chart components. Start by setting up the sample application and running it locally. Then add the time picker, and some time picker features.

## Set up and run the application locally
Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal,  change to the time picker directory.

```shell lineNumbers=false
cd /nr1-howto/add-time-picker
```
</Step>

<Step>

## Make sure you're getting data from the right New Relic account
In your preferred text editor, open the `/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js` and then edit the following line to use your account ID (find your account ID in the Profile section of the Developer Center, where you downloaded the New Relic One CLI):

```jsx
this.accountId = <REPLACE ME WITH YOUR ACCOUNT ID>;
```

</Step>

<Step>

Update the UUID and serve the application by running the following:

```shell lineNumbers=false
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### Next steps
