## üöÄ Local development

You can serve this site locally to quickly see your changes and additions before you PR them. To get started, navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up, as follows.

```sh
cd developer-website/
yarn
yarn start
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

If you want to view the Instant Observability page or a quickstart you'll need to add a `.env.development` file with keys of `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` and `NERDGRAPH_URL`.
ex:

```
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-abc1234456
NERDGRAPH_URL=https://api.newrelic.com/graphql
```

For local production builds (yarn build:production) you'll need to use a `.env.production` file for the env vars.

### Dependencies

Node v16 is used in this project as specified in [.nvmrc](https://github.com/newrelic/developer-website/blob/master/.nvmrc).

## üìù Unit tests
