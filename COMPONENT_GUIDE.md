# Globally available components

## Video

`<Video />` component provides formatting for videos in markdown.

### Usage

The Video component requires two props:

- `id`: the video ID
- `type`: the host of the video. Accepted values are:
  - `wistia`
  - `youtube`

```md
<Video id="zxunt1u1as" type="wistia"/>
```

## Intro

The `<Intro />` component provides formatting for the title and introduction of the markdown document.

### Usage

It takes the title provided in the Frontmatter and accepts plain text for the description. An example of Frontmatter that will have a title of **Example Guide**:

```
---
path: '/example'
duration: '30 min'
title: 'Example Guide'
template: 'GuideTemplate'
description: 'Example guide page'
---
```

It also accepts a `<Video />` component as a child, which it will place on the left side of the description.

```md
<Intro>
This is a description for the markdown guide.

<Video id="zxunt1u1as" type="youtube"/>
</Intro>
```

If there is a more than plain text and a `<Video />` (such as a code snippet or another component) the content will be posted on the left side below the description.

## Steps

The `<Steps />` is a required container for the individual `<Step />` components and will autonumber from top to bottom.

### Usage

The Steps component accepts `<Step/>` components as its children and will increment by the number of child components.

```md
<Steps>

<Step>

## Step 1

Step 1 description.
</Step>

<Step>

## Step 2

Step 2 description
</Step>

</Steps>
```

If there is markdown content not wrapped by a `<Step />` component, it will still auto-increment for that content, so be sure to wrap all content with the Step component. For example:

```md
<Steps>

<Step>
This will read as Step 1 of 3.
</Step>

This will display as is with no step counter.

<Step>
This will read as Step 3 of 3.
</Step>

</Steps>
```

## Step

### Usage

The `<Step />` component renders a single step in the series of steps. This is
meant to use in conjunction with `<Steps />`, so this component **MUST** be
wrapped by `<Steps />` to work properly. The following example will contain 2
steps:

```md
<Steps>
  <Step>Some information about step 1</Step>
  <Step>Some information about step 2</Step>
</Steps>
```

The previous example will interpret the text inside of the `<Step />` as plain
text. If you would like the `<Step />` component to interpret the text as
markdown content, include a line break after the opening tag:

```md
<Step>

# This is a title for the step.

This is some information about this step.
</Step>
```

You can intersperse code blocks inside of the step. Code snippets will always
render in a right column next to the description.

````md
<Step>

# A code example

Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npm start
```

</Step>
````

You can include multiple code blocks in a single step. Code blocks will always
be rendered to the right of the text that precedes it.

````md
<Step>

# Another code example

Run the following in your terminal:

```shell
npm start
```

When that is running, edit index.js and replace the component with the following
code:

```js
return <div>Hello, {props.name}</div>;
```

</Step>
````

## Code Snippet

Code Snippets are automatically formatted by three backticks.

### Usage

There are three props that can be supplied to a code snippet.

- `language`: The first prop must be a code language. [Here](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) is a list of accepted languages for syntax highlighting.

  ````md
  ```jsx
  ```
  ````

- `lineNumbers`: `true` or `false`. Will show line numbers of the left side of the code, defaults to `true`.
  ````md
  ```jsx lineNumbers=false
  ```
  ````
- `copy`: `true` or `false`. Will display or not display the copy button, defaults to `true`
  ````md
  ```jsx copy=false
  ```
  ````
